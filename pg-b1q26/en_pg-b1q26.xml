            questions with objections <!-- motivis --> and solutions.
            And it is divided into two

              everything is always uniformily loved 
              and would never be able not to be loved. 
              The consequent is false

              and non-sinner.

              every rational creature 
              is loved by an immense love, 
              nevertheless no created things 
              immeasurably loveable through an intrinsic worth. 
              The first part is clear 
              because the Father and the Son 
              love every creature 
              through the Holy Spirit, 
              therefore they are loved by an immense love.

              The second part 
              is proved 
              because any created thing 
              has intrinsically a finite worth, 
              therefore from the ratio 
              of his own intrinsic worth 
              he is finitely loveable.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e3248">
              First corollary: 
              every created thing 
              is loved by an infinitely greater love 
              than its intrinsic worth 
              according to which it is positioned in its species.
              This is clear because 
              it is loved by an immeasurable love 
              and it is positioned in a species 
              with an intrinsic worth of finite perfection.

              Second corollary: 
              love or delight ought to be measured 
              precisely according to the worth of a good choice or action.<!-- action for collati?? -->
              This is clear 
              because God loves all things 
              with the same love, 
              and nevertheless he does not confer 
              the good equally to all things.

              nevertheless they are loved 
              by in greater and lesser degrees.
              This is clear 
              because otherwise 
              he would not love a virgin <!-- a virgin vs. the "Virgin" -->

              Second conclusion:

              love all things by the same spirated love 
              and indissoluble connection, 
              nevertheless they love and confer love freely and contingently 
              to a loveable created thing.
              The first part is clear 
              because the Father and the Son 
              love all things with the Holy Spirit, 
              who is love spirated 
              by the Father and the Son 
              and their indissoluble connection.
              The second is clear 
              because three divine persons 
              only perform external actions 
              contingently and freely.

              something is loved through an infinite love 
              and indisolluble connection 
              and that is loved 
              when it is not able to be loved. 
              This is clear 
              because God is able to annihilate some created thing
              and nevertheless to love <!-- it ?? -->, 
              and nevertheless any such thing 
              is loved by the Holy Spirit

              Second corollary: 
              it is the case that 
              God is clearly seen by someone 
              and that God is not loved by the one seeing him.
              This is clear 
              both because God is not necessitated for causing love 
              or loving in someone on account of something distinct from then, 
              and secondly because 
              the one seeing God 
              is able to apprehend God 
              under the ratio of their punisher or afflictor,
              and from this they are able to have displeasure or hate,

              if this were true, 
              it would be the case because
              the one sinning venially would be 
              in a state of greater grace. 
              But this is not
              the case 
              because it would be impossible 
              that something is in the state of grace

              I prove this 
              because the terms of each are incompatible,

              And the antecedent 
              is clear 
              because the claim/motive <!-- translation hard here?? --> 
              of meritorious operation is glory, 
              but the term of venial sin 
              is punishment and misery, 
              at least the sense of it. 
              But these are not compatible in the same thing, 
              indeed it follows that 
              no one would be delayed from their beatitude 
              on account of a venial sin,

              therefore the one meriting eternal life

              increases grace

              In one mode loosely and interpretatively,

            so the Son aught to be said to be wise 
            through itself but not from itself, 
            and similarly ought to be called 
            God through itself 
            but not from itself or by itself. .

          <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e4032">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that there is only one wisdom of the Father, 
            but it is not said in one mode, 
            for the wisdom of the Father is called 
            that which he generated 
            and the wisdom of the Father is called 
            that by which he is wisdom, 
            nevertheless the wisdom of the Father is one thing 
            because by the same person of the Father, 
            which is understood when it is called unbegotten wisdom,
            and the person of the Son,
            which is signified when it is called begotten wisdom, 
            is one and the same wisdom and essence 
            which is common to the three persons.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e4047">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that just as love is in the Trinity 
            which is the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, 
            which is the essence of divinity, 
            and nevertheless love is the Holy Spirit 
            which is not the Father or the Son. 
            Nor therefore are there two loves, 
            but there is only one love in the Trinity 
            because the love which is properly the Holy Spirit, 
            is the love which the Trinity is, 
            nevertheless the Holy Spirit is not the Trinity. 
            In the same way it should be said about wisdom.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e4060">
            Eighth conclusion: 
            that the Father is not said to love the Son 
            nor the Son the Father by this love alone 
            which proceeds from both of them
            which is not a part of them 
            but only the Holy Spirit, <!--loves in this way --> 
            as if the Father or the Son 
            exist through this love. 
            But in this way by this love 
            the Father loves the Son and conversely. 
            such that the Father through this which his 
            loves thus with this love and likewise the Son. <!-- translation review needed here -->
            Thus, though the Father loves the Son 
            through the Holy Spirit and conversely, 
            nevertheless the Father loves the Son 
            by the essential love 
            which he is 
            and in the same way the Son loves the Father.

            First conclusion: 
            that the properties of the persons 
            distinguish and determine the persons 
            and they are in the persons 
            and in the divine essence 
            and they are these divine persons 
            and they are the divine
            <pb ed="#L" n="82-v"/>
            essence,
            and the reason is because 
            God is everything that he has, 
            apart from what is said relatively, 
            for the Father has the Son, 
            but he is not the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e4090">
            Second conclusion: 
            that the properties 
            are in the divine persons in one way 
            and in the divine essence in another. 
            For in the divine essence 
            they are present in such a way that 
            they do not determine nor distinguish it, 
            but in the persons 
            they are present in such a way that 
            they determine and distinguish the persons, 
            and therefore the essence 
            does not generate nor is generated
            but the Father generates 
            and the Son is generated.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q26-d1e4100">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the by the property of generation 
            the Father is God and not the divine essence, 
            and nevertheless this property is God and the divine essence.
