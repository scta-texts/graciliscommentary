            After the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined 
            about beginning of the temporal mission, 
            now he determined about the different modes <!-- plural seems to fit better, though ms has singular. -->
            of this type of mission, 
            and he divided it into two parts 
            because in the first place he determines 
            about the sensible and visible mode, 
            in the second place about the invisible 
            and internally perceptible. 
            The second begins in distinction 17.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e111">
            The first part is divided into two parts 
            because in the first part 
            he describes the visible mission of the Holy Spirit, 
            in the second place 
            he makes a comparison of this mission 
            to the mission of the Son.

            And this is divided into three, 
            for he shows in the first place 
            that the Holy Spirit by reason of the mission 
            is not referred to by the beginning of the sending, 
            in the second place 
            because the Son according to which man is less 
            than the entire trinity and also himself, 
            in the third place he shows how 
            the Father is able to be called greater than then Son.

            Whether the species in which the sent Holy Spirit appeared visibly

              That not
              because then 
              it would follow that 
              the distinction of such visible species 
              would imply proportionally a distinction of things known. 
              The consequent is false 
              because every cognition of the created intellect 
              is placed in the genus of quality, 
              but the species in which the Holy Spirit 
              appear are not always 
              in the same genus. 
              This is clear from the the case of the
              dove and the fire. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because active causes 
              differing in species 
              acting naturally 
              not freely 
              cause specifically distinct actions.
              But these species are natural things, 
              therefore, 
              if they change the intellect by co-creating cognition in it, 
              it follows that there will be a diversity of cognitions 
              on account of a diversity of species. 
              This is confirmed 
              because in

                  it follows the distinction of acts and operations

              In the second place,
              species existing in the created memory 
              actuate the potency only mentally 
              but not causally, 
              therefore species existing 
              extrinsically do not actuate causally or create change. 
              The consequence 
              holds because the argument does not apply less to one than to the other. 
              And the antecedent is clear through

            <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e269">
              The first conclusion: 
              though the divine person 
              appearing in a visible mission 
              is able to be believed to create 
              such a species without a second cause, 
              nevertheless it possible that the blessed angels 
              form such corporal species. 
              The first part is clear 
              because God able to do alone 
              whatever he is able to with another 
              in the genus of the efficient cause.
              The second part is proved 
              because according to 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q15-Rd1e283">

            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e295">
              The first corollary: 
              though the dove 
              in which the Holy Spirit appeared visibly 
              was formed by the angels, 
              nevertheless only the humanity 
              suppositionally united to Christ by the three persons 
              was created.
              The first is clear from the conclusion. 
              The second is proved both since in the reason of dignity 
              of that suppositional union 
              it proper that this matter 
              is immediately produced by God, 
              and in the second place 
              because it was formed in an instant. 
              But this does not seem able 
              to happen from a finite power, 
              as I now supposed. 
              This is also seen in Scripture  
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q15-Rd1e308">

              etc.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e340">
              Second corollary: 
              though an angel is able to produce 
              a corporeal sign of the temporal mission of the divine person, 
              nevertheless the angel is not able in any way to effect 
              the thing signified by this kind of sign.
              This is clear 
              because this gratuitous gift 
              added to the mind 
              is produced by God alone. <!-- translation could be "this gift which has been produced by God alone is added to the mind --> 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e353">
              Third corollary: 
              just as the gift signified
              through a species is not subordinated to angelic activity, 
              so not the angel but the divine person 
              whose nature relates to this gift <!-- loose translation --> 
              is said to appear or to be sent.
              This is clear 
              because this gift signified through the species 
              declares and denominates a sent person. 
              And therefore, 
              if this gift is a kind of wisdom, 
              then it is able to be said that the Son is sent 
              because wisdom is attributed to him. 
              If it is a kind of love or mercy, 
              then the Holy Spirit. 
              If it is a kind of authority or power, 
              then the Father is able to be said to appear, 
              nevertheless he is not sent because 
              he does not originate from anything.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e375">
              For these things 
              it would be possible 
              to infer that, 
              though the angels are not able to be creatures, 
              nevertheless they are able to be producers of creatable things.
              The first part is clear 
              because to create is for something 
              to independently move through production 
              from non being to being. 
              The second part is clear 
              because, 
              as it has been said, 
              this dove in the mystery of those things was produced, 
              which was able to be created, 
              indeed would be able to be recreated by God.

              Second conclusion: 
              the sensible species 
              assisting extrinsically 
              and intrinsically in the existence of the memory 
              vitally changes the intellect and actuates it 
              as an object and causally. 
              This is clear, 
              with respect to species extrinsically existing,
              through 
              <cit>

              Again, it is clear 
              through the

              </cit>.
              The second part is proved 
              because, 
              if such a species is existing in the memory intrinsiscally 
              and does not change the potency as an object, 
              then it would follows that there would not be a
              different between and habitual specie and a habitual concept in act, 
              which is false 
              because then someone having such a species actually 
              would know it, 
              which should not be said.
              This last consequence is clear 
              because phantasm is a 
              is the habitual word of the sensible species, 
              as is clear through

              The first corollary: 
              it is stands that some vitally power changes 
              and this is neither the vital form 
              nor its formal act.
              This is clear because 
              the voice and the fire 
              and many other sensible species change 
              the created intellect through the the senses, 
              and nevertheless such species are vital forms, 
              nor
              <pb ed="#L" n="51-r"/> 
              is this change the formal act of these species,

              The second corollary: 
              it is the case that the intellect apprehends something 
              and is moved vitally by the same thing, 
              and the thing moving is really and seated in the intellect. 
              This is clear through
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q15-Rd1e454">

              Third corollary:

              so also is it possible to apprehend cogitively <!-- translation ?? cogitively ?? -->  
              something not existing 
              through a representing species . 
              This is clear because 
              just as one knows an absent and distant thing 
              through a species abstractively, 
              so concerning a thing not existing 
              it is possible to have a species 
              and through this to conceive something,

              when angels form some body 
              from the elements 
              by applying something to active to passive things,

            This distinction contains six conclusions. 
            The first is that there is a double procession 
            of the Holy Spirit, 
            an eternal one which proceeds from the Father and the Son 
            and not from itself, 
            another temporal one which is called 
            mission or giving. And the latter
            is twofold, 
            one visible 
            when it appears, 
            as at the day of Pentecost 
            or in the baptism of Christ in the species of a dove, 
            another invisible which is given 
            to the minds of the faithful. 
            And in this manner 
            it is given through a double giving, 
            not only by the Father and the Son, 
            but also by itself. 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e1027">
            The second conclusion: 
            that the Son also is said to be sent in two ways, 
            in one mode visibly 
            when he appeared in the flesh, 
            in another mode when he is perceived by pious minds.

            Third conclusion: 
            though the Holy Spirit 
            is not seen visibly in its own nature, 
            nevertheless it is sent 
            and this occurs through a visible species.

            Fourth conclusion:

            that in other things, 
            but it is shown through these things 
            because the Holy Spirit is in these things 
            through sanctifications and grace 
            to which these species or created things come.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q15-d1e1051">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that the Son assumed the nature in which appeared 
            differently than the Holy Spirit 
            because the Son assumed it through the hypostatic union, 
            but not the Holy Spirit,
            <pb ed="#L" n="52-v"/>
            and the Son accepted man and humanity 
            so that he would become man, 
            but the Holy Spirit did not accept the form of a dove 
            so that it would become a dove. 
            And therefore the Son is said more the Father 
            according to its accepted nature, 
            but not the Holy Spirit.

            Sixth conclusion:

            is less than the Father and the Holy Spirit

            but only the notional authority of the origin 
            because the Father originates the Son, 
            therefore the Son is equal to the Father in actual reality 
            because every perfections 
            which the Father has, the Son has. 
            But the Father is said to be greater than the Son 
            in the mode of having 
            because the Son has this perfection from the Father 
            and the not the reverse.
            Also note that
            <name ref="#HilaryOfPoitiers">Hilary</name> 
            does not concede that the Son is less than the Father 
            both because minority seems to convey indignity
