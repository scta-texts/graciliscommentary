            etc. after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined 
            about the generation of the Son and the procession of the Holy Spirit, 
            now he treats about each of them individually by comparison, 
            and he divides this into two parts
            because in the first place he inquires about the order of procession, 
            in the second place 
            he shows the difference between generation and spiration.

            in such a way that faith concedes that 
            it is neither unbegotten or begotten, 
            whether the Holy Spirit is produced

              It truly seems that this is not the case

              it would follow that 
              the pilgrim theologian would be able to know 
              the difference or the distinction between generation and procession.

              In the second place, 
              the internal productions of the divine are of the same reasons and species, 
              therefore just as the Son through one is said to be begotten, 
              so the Holy Spirit for a similarity in species 
              is able to be called begotten. 
              The consequence is clear because 
              specific identity of production and of producing and the produced terms 
              argue sufficiently for the identity of the denomination or of the natural properties, 
              otherwise it would be the case that 
              the production of <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name> and <name ref="#Plato">Plato</name> 
              would be of the same species, 
              and nevertheless one would be of the same species and the other would not.
              The antecedent is first proved 
              because the terms or persons produced through these productions do not differ in species, 
              but only numerically or personally.

              The consequence is clear

              The first conclusion: 
              though it is impossible that 
              the production of the Son 
              is not distinguished from the production of the Holy Spirit, 
              nevertheless from the common law in the present life 
              no one is able to know this distinction with evident reason.
              The first is proved 
              because otherwise it would be possible that 
              there is in the divine 
              which now de facto is, 
              if these productions were not distinguished. 
              But this is impossible, 
              therefore.
              The impossibility is clear 
              through what is said above
              because in whatever way the divine is internally,
              it is necessarily that way.

              The first corollary: in which
              <pb ed="#L" n="43-r"/> 
              it does not follow evidently that the 
              the Son is produced only by the Father 
              and that the Holy Spirit is produced by both, 
              therefore the generation of the Son 
              is distinguished from the procession of the Holy Spirit.
              This is clear because the unity or plurality of the one's producing 
              does not imply the plurality or distinction of the productions, 
              most especially where there is one mode of acting, 
              as is the case in what has been proposed,

              Second conclusion: 
              a specific distinction between the divine persons is as repugnant 
              as the same distinction between eternal productions. 
              This is proved 
              because it is repugnant in both cases, 
              therefore it is equally repugnant.
              The consequences is clear 
              because the repugnance or the opposition of a contradiction 
              does not have latitude nor can it be more or less when taken in the same way. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because every specific distinction 
              argues and implies diversity of nature.
              But such diversity is repugnant to the divine essence, 
              therefore a specific distinction 
              in the divine persons or productions should not be asserted. 
              The second part is proved 
              because productions are not distinct 
              unless by reason of a distinction of the persons 
              or because it terminates in distinct persons. 
              But the persons are not distinguished in species 
              but only in number, therefore.
              In the second place, 
              the conclusion is proved 
              because the divine supposites are absolutely of the same perfection, 
              therefore they are of the same species. 
              The consequence holds 
              because, just as no two species are of the same perfection, 
              so etc.

              The first part is proved

              In the second mode,
              the divine essence is said to unbegotten.
              In the third mode, 
              only the Father is unbegotten and,

            This distinction contains three conclusions. 
            First: 
            that when it is asked 
            whether the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father 
            earlier than from the Son, 
            it should be said that 
            whoever is able to understand 
            the generation of the Son from the Father without time 
            also understands that the procession of the Holy Spirit 
            from both the Father and the Son is without time 
            because in the Trinity 
            nothing is before or after 
            because there nothing begins from time.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1155">
            Second conclusio:
            that just as the Holy Spirit 
            did not proceed from the Father before the Son, 
            so he does not proceed from the Father 
            more greatly 
            or more amply 
            or more fully 
            that from the Son.

            Distinction 13 contains seven conclusion
            First: 
            that though the Holy Spirit proceeds 
            from the Father and is from the substance of the Father, 
            just as the Son is, 
            nevertheless he is not said to be born or begotten, 
            and therefore it is not called the son, 
            the reason for which is 
            because, 
            if it were called the Son, 
            then it would be the Son of the Father 
            when it proceeds from Both. 
            But it is absurd that it is the Son of both 
            because nothing is the Son of two things 
            unless of a father and mother.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1211">
            Second conclusion:
            that though the Son and the Holy Spirit proceed 
            from the Father, 
            nevertheless they do so differently 
            because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father 
            in the mode of a gift 
            or as a gift, 
            but the Son proceeds 
            as born as or as begotten, 
            and therefore the Holy Spirit is not the Son
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1225">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit is not called the Son 
            because it is not begotten just as something unbegotten 
            nor is it made 
            as something would be born through the grace of God in adoption, 
            just as we are also, 
            and thus it would be said to be the Son of God through adoption.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1237">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that it is not the case that it was born 
            because it proceeds,
            although everything that is born proceeds
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1242">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that we are not able in this life 
            to sufficiently distinguish 
            between the generation of the Word 
            and the procession of the Holy Spirit, 
            and therefore it 
            suffices for everyone to know that the Son 
            is not from himself, 
            but from the Father,
            and nor is the Holy Spirit from himself,
            but proceeds from both.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1253">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that according to 
            <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>, 
            the Holy Spirit ought not to be called 
            begotten nor unbegotten 
            because, 
            if he were begotten, 
            then there would be two sons in the divine. 
            but if it were unbegotten, 
            then we would affirm that there are two fathers, 
            which is inconvenient. 
            This is clear 
            because to be unbegotten 
            properly belongs to the Father.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q12-d1e1264">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that according to 
            <name ref="#Jerome">Ieromium</name> 
            the Holy Spirit is said to be unbegotten, 
            but <name ref="#Jerome">Jerome</name> 
            understands the word <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> 
            for that which is not begotten, 
            and in this way it is possible to conceded that the Holy Spirit 
            is unbegotten, that is not begotten.
            But 
            <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>
            understands <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> 
            for that which 
            is not from another, 
            and yet is other than something, 
            and thus by taking <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> in this way 
            it is said of the Father alone 
            because the Son is from another 
            and the Holy Spirit is from the Father and the Son 
            who are different persons. 
            And thus the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            agrees with the saying of 
            <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name> 
            and <name ref="#Jerome">Jerome</name>.
            And these things suffice for the present lecture.
