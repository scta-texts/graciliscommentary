             This is the sixth distinction, 
             which is a continuation of the preceding. 
             For after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined 
             about divine generation with respect to the thing generating 
             and the thing generated, now he begins to treat this matter 
             with respect to the mode of generation, and this is divided into three parts.
             For in the first place he proposes the question, 
             in the second place he offers a solution, 
             and in the third place he explains 
             the declaration of the response.

            Regarding this distinction it is asked whether 
            the fecund memory of the Father willing and freely determined 
            to beget the Son who is the second person.

              That not because the Father 
              produces naturally, 
              therefore not freely.
              The consequence holds 
              and the antecedent is proved through
              <ref><name ref="#JohnDamascenus">Damascene</name> in book one, chapter eight</ref>

              In the second place, it follows that 
              the generation of the Son would be an operation of the will.
              The consequent seems false 
              because it is an act of the memory of the Father.
              The consequence is clear because complacence or to please 
              is an act of the will according to
              <cit>
                <ref>

              </cit>. 
              This is confirmed 
              because the act of the eternal supposite is 
              an essential act, 
              therefore no more determined to begetting the Son 
              than the Son is determined to this, therefore.
              The conclusion is false, 
              the consequences valid, 
              and the antecedent apparent 
              because every internal act of the Father is 
              an immanent act 
              and therefore essential and common to the whole.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q7-d1e170">
              In the third place, 
              The Father is determined for begetting the Son 
              in no way, therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved because 
              to be determined indicates an imperfection, 
              therefore it should not be attributed to the Father or 
              any other divine supposite. 
              The proof of the antecedent is <!-- translation difficult here; needs review --> 
              because for something to be determined by something 
              is effectively to have been produced by that, or produced, or at least moved.

              This is confirmed by reason in the following way: 
              the eternal generation of the word is the most perfect operation, 
              there it is a pleasing and free operation. 
              The consequences holds because according to the  
              <cit>
                <ref><name ref="#Aristotle">Philosopher</name> in book II and X of the <title ref="#Ethics">Ethics</title></ref>
                <bibl>Aristotles, Ethics, X (1174b31-33) <!-- note from stefano: Here, however, Peter is actually copying from Thomas of Strasburg, I Sent., d. 6, q. 2: “Contra, delectabilissima operatio non potest esse sine actu voluntatis, sed generare divinum est delectabilissima operatio, ergo etc. Maior patet, quia nulla potest esse delectation absue complacentia voluntatis; minore probo, quia operatio perfectissima est delectabilisissima; patet, 1 et 10 Ethicorum..." --></bibl>
              </cit>, 
              the most perfect operation is the most pleasant.
              The antecedent is proved because in whatever degree 
              the produced term is of a greater perfection, 
              the operation or production is more perfect in the same degree. 
              But the Son in the divine is of an infinite perfection, 
              therefore also his production. 
              But for this the Father is not undetermined, 
              therefore he is determined

            <p xml:id="pgb1q7-d1e228">
              The first conclusion: 
              though the infallible Word is beget immutably 
              with the necessity of exigence, 
              nevertheless without perfection 
              the Father generates it with delight 
              and for the sake of pleasure.
              The first part is proved 
              because the same thing which is pure act 
              necessarily drives forward such 
              that it exists in three supposits. 
              But these three things would not be 
              unless the Father were to generate the Son, 
              and the Father and the Son spirated the Holy Spirit. 
              Therefore, from the necessity of natural exigence, 
              The Son is beget from the Father. 
              And this is confirmed because the Father 
              is not able not to beget the Word, 
              therefore he necessarily generates it.

              The first corollary: 
              though the Father begets with the necessity of exigence, 
              nevertheless this necessity excludes both 
              the necessity of co-action or indigence.
              The first part is clear through the conclusion. 
              The second is clear because contra

              The second conclusion: 
              just as it is repugnant that the paternal memory 
              produced a fallible word from eternity, 
              so it is repugnant that every aeternal act is or was notional. 
              The first part is clear through what was said in

              Nevertheless this is confirmed 
              because it is repugnant that something 
              fallible exists but is not measured by time. 
              Therefore no such thing was able 
              to be produced without time.
              The second part is proved because the act of 
              predestination of Peter or another is an eternal act 
              and is not notional, indeed it is common to three persons,

              The first corollary: 
              the futurition or the privation of no-thing either absolutely  
              lacks a beginning in time or always was or was eternally. 
              This is clear because futurition and privation are similar things 
              either are something or nothing. 
              If nothing, then they were neither temporally nor eternally. 
              If they are something, then they are either a creator or creature. 
              Not the first,
              because this is a pure act that is always present. 
              If it is different from God, then it follows 
              that they were not from eternity, 
              as is clear through the first part of the conclusion and its proof.
              From what has been said it seems to follow that 
              contradictories would not would not be able to be at the same time,

              In the second place it would be able to be inferred 
              that to the negation of things to have eternally existed, 
              it follows that produced something outside of himself eternally.
              This is clear because, if God eternally produced nothing outside himself, 
              then the negation of nothing thing existed from eternity, which is against

              The second part is proved because to be determined properly in this way

              The antecedent is clear

              This is clear

              Therefore, if there are posited a multitude of eternal acts, 
              it is necessary to posit a multitude of gods, which is nonsense.
              This is confirmed because in the divine

              and so for similar things.

              But the act of love in the Father and the Son,

              produces the Son antecedently principative,

              and nor does it appear to us just as the other. 
              Therefore it does not follow that,

                    Gracilis appears to make a mistake here in the citation of this incipit. 
                    The incipit of d. 6 reads, as stated at the outset of this question, "praeterea quaeri solet". 
                    This incipit stated here actually mirrors the incipit of <ref target="http://scta.info/resource/pll1d7c1-d1e3476">distinction 7, c. 1</ref>. 
                    This similarity of the incipits likely accounts for the accidental reference to distinction 7, when actually referring to distinction 6.

            This distinction contains 
            three conclusions. 
            First that just as God the Father is God neither by necessity or by will, 
            neither by not-willing or willing, 
            so God the Father beget the Son neither by necessity or by will, 
            he begin him neither by not-willing or willing, 
            contrary to the understanding of the heretic.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q7-d1e819">
            The second conclusion that, 
            though in God nature and will are the same thing, 
            nevertheless it does not follow that, 
            if the Word of God is the Son by nature, 
            that on account of this he is the Son by will, 
            just as it does not follows that 
            the foreknowledge and the divine will are the same, 
            therefore whatever is said about one is said about the other. 
            For foreknowledge is about the good and the bad, 
            but the will is truly only about the good 
            or with respect to the good.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q7-d1e831">
            Third conclusion that the Father begat the Son willingly just as he was able,
            and the good begat him and also wisdom, 
            nevertheless not by a preceding or following will, 
            nor did he beget the Son by a necessitated natural coactions or leading. 
            And therefore not by unwillingly, but willingly he generated him, 
            namely by an approving will and pleasing will, 
            as was said about, etc.
