              The consequent is false

              which in no mode should be posited 
              in the simplicity of the divine essence. 
              The consequence is clear

            <p xml:id="pgb1q22-d1e3269">
              The first conclusion: 
              though number secundum quid 
              is obtainable from corporeal things, 
              nevertheless number absolutely is
              in discoverable in spiritual things.
              The first part is proved 
              because number is a plurality of unities 
              or several unities, 
              therefore number secundum quid 
              in is able to be posited in corporeal unities.
              The consequences is clear 
              because, 
              if several unitieis are number, 
              it follows that those unities 
              which are not unities absolutley
              but secundum quid 
              do not constitute number absolutely 
              but secundum quid, 
              but in corporeal things nothing is one absolutely, 
              therefore.
              This is clear 
              since any such things is composed 
              from several parts or uniities, 
              namely from matter and form.

              The second part is proved 
              because number absolutely 
              is unity absolutely 
              or plurality of simple unities, 
              but this kind of simplicity 
              is only found in spiritual things,

              The first corollary:

              for a any plurality of really distinct things 
              then number absolutely should be put in the divine. 
              But if it were taken 
              for plurality of some things 
              neither existing or constituting one thing through itself,

              number be totally removed 
              from the divine persons.
              The first part is clear 
              because the blessed trinity 
              is a true plurality of persons distinct from one another. 
              The second is proved 
              because these persons are 
              one through themselves essentially 
              because something composed

              is not called number 
              because they are one this something, 
              therefore a fortiori the uncreated trinity, 
              since it is one most simple essence,
              is not number in the mode taken. 
              And in this sense 
              should the authorities be taken

              Second corollary: 
              that no number absolutely 
              is an accident inhering formally in numerated things. 
              This is clear 
              since no accident should be put in God 
              and number absolutely is there. 
              This is confirmed 
              because, 
              if number were an accident, 
              either it divisible or indivisible. 
              Not the first 
              because no number is 
              divisible into many numbers, 
              as is clear from a binary.
              Again, 
              should any of these numbers have parts
              it would be able to be asked about them 
              without end. 
              Nor the second

              And nor is it able to be said 
              that it is divisible into unities, 
              since numeric unities 
              are not superadded to numerated things, 
              but are things themselves.
              It follows that 
              number is not a divisible accident.
              Again, 
              it follows that the same accident 
              would be in many things separated 
              in place by a maximum distance. 
              The consequences is clear 
              because the number one hundred of men/to man would be in some of them, 
              since there is not a greater reason for it to be one 
              than in another or in all.

              or a numerating mind.
              This is clear because otherwise
              when such an acts ceases 
              number would cease, 
              and thus when a disordered rich person does not

              indeed this person would have neither more nor less 
              than any poor person. 
              The consequence is clear

              It is proved

              is in anything is better it is than it is not,

              The conclusion is true. 
              The consequence is valid.

              Note nevertheless

              <name ref="#Anselm">
                Anselm
              </name> 
              ought to be understood thus, 
              that perfection absolutely is 
              that through which, for any single thing
              in which it is, it is better 
              that it is than if it were not in this, 
              and were not this, 
              and were not in it formally, 
              and were not in another equivalently or virtually, 
              from which it follows that
              <name ref="#Anselm">Anselm's</name> 
              description of absolute perfection in itself 
              and in the sense 
              which it makes <!-- he makes? who Anselm? the opponent ? -->
              does not seem true. 
              This is clear because, 
              so understood, 
              it would follows from this 
              that nothing would be absolutely perfect. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because nothing is that which for every single thing 
              is better than not being 
              because either this would be the creator or creature. 
              It is not the creator 
              because it would not be better for me 
              to be God than not to be God 
              because 
              through being God 
              I would become not me.
              Nor would this be a creature 
              because it would not be better 
              for God to be a creature than not to be a creature.

              This is clear

              The second part is proved 
              because that which we conceive 
              or are able to conceive in some mode, 
              we are able to express and name that through names, 
              since words are signs of the passions and coneptus of the mind. 
              But through the first part,
              we are able to conceive God in some mode,

              The first corollary:

              This is clear 
              because the world <mentioned>being</mentioned>
              seems most especially to be univocal and common to them, 
              but this is false.
              This is clear because 
              God suits the created being

              but in the divine itself
              in innumerable things there is not plurality of quantums,

              The major is clear 
              because every such number 
              is a type of quantity 
              because it is discrete quantity, 
              as is clear in what has been proved.

              The consequent is false 
              because then some numbers of the same species 
              would be unequal. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because six men 
              and five are of the same species 
              because all men are of the same particular species, 
              and nevertheless they are not equal numbers.
              Again in the same mode, 
              it follows that equal numbers

              The consequence is clear 
              since every number is quantity 
              and numerated things are substances.

            one God,
            a multitude of gods is ruled out 
            and quantity of number in diversity is not posited. 
            Similarly, 
            when it is said, 
            one is the Father, 
            one is the Son, 
            the ratio of what is said id that 
            there are not many father nor many sons, 
            such that these names are posited more greatly 
            for excluding those things 
            which are not in God 
            than for putting something there.

            we do not put diversity or multiplicity there.\

            neither the Father alone, 
            nor the Son alone are in the divine,

            Fifth conclusion: 
            that when it is said, 
            there are distinct persons 
            or there is a distinction in the persons, 
            we exclude confusion and mixture, 
            and we do not signify that this one 
            is not that one.

            Sixth conclusion: 
            when we say, 
            this one and this other one are persons, 
            we do not posit there diversity or otherness,

            and distinction or discretion 
            is suitably said to be there,

            Eighth conclusion:

            the same thing seems to be signified,
            that three persons, 
            et just as Father is not bale to be called three persons, 
            so neither is it able to be said that the Faither is Trinity

            says that truth is singular, 
            he understands singular for that which
            others understand to be one, 
            but when he says that Trinity is manifold and numerical
            he understands multiplicity and numerosity,

            etc. 
            This distinction 25 
            contains three conclusions. 
            First: 
            that the name of person in the divine 
            serves a triple ratio in the Trinity. 
            For sometimes it makes an understanding of the creature, 
            as when it is said, 
            Father is the a person, 
            the son is a person, 
            the Holy Spirit is a person, 
            that is essence
          </p>
          
          <p xml:id="pgb1q22-d1e4374">
            Second conclusion: 
            that this name person 
            sometimes make for an understanding of the 
            hypostasis or subsistence according to the Greeks, 
            as when it is said, 
            one thing is the person of the Father, 
            another of the Son, 
            another of the Holy Spirit, 
            that is, 
            one is the hypostasis of the Father 
            or another subsistence according to the Greeks.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q22-d1e4384">
            The third conclusion: 
            that this name person 
            sometimes is taken for a property, 
            as when it is said, 
            one is personally 
            or another is personally, 
            or the Son is personally, 
            that is, 
            the Father by his own property 
            is other than the Son, 
            and the Son by his own property 
            is other than the Father, 
            for by the paternal property 
            the hypostasis of the Father 
            is distinguished from the hypostasis of the Son 
            with the filial property 
            and the Holy Spirit by procession property 
            is distinguished from each. 
            And these are things for this present distinction 
            and consequently for the entire lecture.
