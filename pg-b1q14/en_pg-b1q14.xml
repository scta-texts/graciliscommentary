              This is distinction 15 
              which connects to the proceeding thus, 
              for after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> showed that the Holy Spirit proceeds 
              from the Father and the Son, 
              now he inquires 
              whether the Holy Spirit is able to give or send itself. 
              And this is divided into three parts
              because he first shows that Holy Spirit sometimes sends itself, 
              second he wishes to concludes this from the sending of the Son, 
              third he asks whether we are now able to say that the Father has been sent.
              The second begins at

              The first part remains undivided,

              because in the first place he shows 
              that the beginning o the mission of the Son is manifold, 
              in the second place he says that varied mode of this same mission.

              concludes the mission of the Holy spirit from the mission of the Son, 
              now he inquires about the manifold mission of the Son 
              and divides into two

              <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
              shows there is a diverse mode of the mission of the Son,

              Whether it ought to be admitted 
              that any divine supposite is sent to any theologian;
              whether temporal mission of the Holy Spirit is a vital perception 
              in the created mind; whether it is the case 
              that the Holy Spirit is received from another 
              and is in no way perceived by the one receiving it; 
              whether it is the case that one receives the Holy Spirit 
              and that same one having it in himself 
              does not vitally perceive it.

              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-aqsqpp">
                It is argued thus
                because to receive is purely passive and to perceive is active, 
                therefore one is able to stand without the other. 
                The consequence holds 
                because with respect to the same terms 
                the created mind is not able at the same time 
                to be purely passive and active, 
                since perceiving is not formally 
                <pb ed="#L" n="48-r"/>
                passive, 
                and also because 
                the perceptive power is universally more perfect 
                than a passive power.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e211">
                In the second place, 
                if the question were true,
                it would follows that be fitting for any divine person 
                to be perceived by the same one 
                by whom it would be proper to be sent.
                The consequent is false 
                because it appropriate for the Father to be perceived, 
                and nevertheless it is not fitting for him to be sent, 
                as is clear  
                <cit>
                  <ref xml:id="pg-b1q14-Rd1e236" target="http://scta.info/resource/pll1d15c9-d1e3477">in the penultimate chapter of this distinction</ref>
                  <bibl>Lombardus, Sent., I, d. 15, c. 9</bibl>
                </cit>. 
                The consequence is clear 
                because, 
                if the sending and the perception are the same, 
                it follows that to be perceived and to be sent 
                are the same.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e223">
                In the third place, 
                if the question were true, 
                it would follows that anyone existing in grace 
                would perceive evidently. 
                The consequent is 
                he is worthy by love or hate. 
                And the consequence is clear 
                because to perceive something 
                is to know it. 
                In the second place,
                it follows that the newly baptized 
                would have a mental perception of grace or of the Holy Spirit. 
                In the third place, 
                it follows that 
                someone would receive grace 
                as intense as they perceive it. 
                The consequent is false 
                because then the virgin 
                would have had a more intense perception 
                than someone, indeed than any angel, 
                because she received 
                more grace than any angel.

              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e267">
                First conclusion: 
                though the created intellective potency 
                is in some way active with respect to some mission or vision of the divine, 
                nevertheless no creature is able to be actively disposed, 
                with respect to the expression of the uncreated word, 
                through the mode of speaking.
                The first part is clear 
                because in heaven the created intellective 
                potency with respect to enjoyment 
                is actively disposed.
                The consequence holds, 
                and the antecedent is clear through
                the <title ref="#Decretals">Decretals</title> God bless 
                our fruition stands or our formal beatitude consists 
                in two acts of the because of the intellect and will 
                which is the entire latitude of formal glory.
                The second part is clear 
                because it follows that the uncreated Word 
                would be a terminus 
                produced from a created intellective power. 
                The consequent is false, 
                and the consequence is clear 
                because it does not seem possible 
                that the saying of anyone saying 
                this is to speak a produced terminus of the same thing,
                and thus to speak would have a created uncreated terminus, 
                which is false.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e299">
                The first corollary: 
                though the blessed soul is able 
                to effectively concur with its own fruition, 
                nevertheless it is not able to produce the light of glory in any mode.
                The first part is clear from the conclusion 
                because such a light is producible by God alone.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e308">
                The second corollary: 
                though the created memory is able to be elevated 
                beatifically through the divine essence as if an intellective species, 
                nevertheless it is not the case that by this the uncreated Word is properly formed. 
                This is clear because 
                then the finite potency would produce an immeasurable term.

                </cit>
                asserts the opposite of this corollary.
                The first part of is clear 
                because God is able to supply 
                two efficient causes in turn.

                The third corollary: 
                though the blessed soul is disposed passively with respect to fruition, 
                nevertheless the same thing is able to be disposed 
                actively with respect to cognition and delight. 
                The first part is clear 
                because it is receptive of these acts. 
                The second part is clear 
                through what is said

                Second conclusion: 
                though it is appropriate only for the 
                Holy Spirit and the Son to be sent, 
                nevertheless active mission is proper 
                to each divine person. 
                The first part is clear 
                because to be sent is not appropriate for the Father, 
                but it is for the Son and Holy Spirit.

                The second part is proved 
                because the external work of the Trinity is undivided, 
                but to send some person, etc.,

                First corollary: 
                it is not more repugnant for the Son to be sent by the Spirit 
                that it is for the Son to be the spirator of the Holy Spirit.
                This is clear from what has been said 
                because from each is true and

                Third corollary: 
                the perception of any divine person under a bodily species 
                is not the passive mission of the same person.
                This is clear 
                because the Father 
                is not sent, 
                and nevertheless appeared under a bodily likeness

                From what has been said it is clear

                Third conclusion:

                and that it is no way perceived by the one receiving it,

                non one is able to knowing perceive 
                that he loves God meritoriously.
                The first part is clear 
                because temporal sending of the Holy Spirit 
                is a vital perception in the created mind,

                The first corollary:
                while the law stand,

                that they have ordinate love, 
                nevertheless someone ought to believe 
                that they have the sending of the Holy Spirit.
                The first is clear from what has been said.
                The second is proved 
                because someone ought to believe that they have charity, 
                therefore. 
                The consequence holds because 
                for the Holy Spirit to be sent into the mind 
                is for charity to be infused in the mind, 
                as the conclusion says.
                And the antecedent is clear 
                from an adult approaching a sacrament 
                by which grace is conferred, 
                just as in the case of baptism and the eucharist.

                The second corollary: 
                it is not the case that the fruit of the divine mission 
                increases in the mind and the vital perception of God is not intensified in the same thing. 
                This is clear 
                because, 
                if not,
                if follows that

                The consequence is clear 
                because it is an external relation of reason. 
                Or it speaks a relation to that which is sending,

                Also the church says that concerning those 
                receiving the sacrament of the eucharist, 
                as is clear from

                To the third, 
                the consequence is conceded 
                as well as the consequent, 
                and the further consequence is denied, 
                but if follows well 
                that he ought to be in such a state 
                in which he believes that he is in charity,

                To the fourth, 
                the consequent would be able to be conceded 
                regarding habitual cognition, 
                but not actual, 
                about which I speak in the conclusion and corollary. 
                Again, 
                it would be possible to be said 
                that such cognition is intensified, 
                nevertheless not in the being of cognition, 
                but only in the being of experiential perception. 
                This is clear from what has been said.

            This distinction contains seven conclusions. 
            The first: that the Holy Spirit 
            is God and gift, 
            and therefore he gives and is given. 
            He gives inasmuch as he is God, 
            and is given inasmuch as he is gift, 
            and as such he is not less 
            than the Father or the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e953">
            The second conclusion: 
            if the Holy Spirit were not able to give himself, 
            then the Father and the Son would be able to give something 
            which the Holy Spirit is not able to give 
            and Father and the Son would do something 
            which the Holy Spirit is not able to do,
            which is inconvenient 
            because external work of the Trinity 
            <pb ed="#L" n="50r"/> 
            is undivided. 
            Therefore 
            it follows that the Holy Spirit 
            proceeds temporally, 
            is sent, 
            and is given from itself.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e965">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the Father is never read as having been sent, 
            but only the Son and the Holy Spirit. 
            But the Son is sent by the Father 
            and himself 
            and by the Holy Spirit, 
            and this sending was the incarnation 
            which was a common work in three persons.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e974">
            The fourth conclusion: 
            that when the Son says 
            in 
            <ref xml:id="pg-b1q14-Rd1e803"><title ref="io">John</title> <sic>8</sic></ref>

              <quote xml:id="pg-b1q14-Qd1e812" source="http://scta.info/resource/io7_28">I have not come from myself</quote>
              <bibl>John 7:28</bibl>
            </cit>,
            this was said according to the form of a servant 
            but the incarnation was not done according to this form, 
            but rather according to the form of God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e988">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            The Son of God is further being eternally generated, 
            on account of which he is said to be sent, 
            but according to which he is better and more truly said to be begotten.
            He is said to be sent in two ways,
            either because he appeared visibly in the world in the flesh, 
            or because moves himself invisibly into pious souls, 
            as is perceived and known by them. 
            In the first mode, 
            he was sent a single time. 
            In the second mode, 
            he is sent every day, 
            not with the result that he is a man, 
            but that he is with man.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e1002">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            though the Father is known from time, 
            just as the Son, 
            nevertheless he is not said to be sent 
            because in the Father 
            is the authority of the principle 
            because he is the principle of the Son 
            and the Holy Spirit, 
            and he does not have a that from which he is.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q14-d1e1010">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            The Father is not therefore 
            said to have sent the Son 
            and the Holy Spirit 
            because, just some heretics think, he is greater and they are lesser, 
            but on account of an authority of suitable principle 
            and because the Father did not appear in a visible creature, 
            as the Son and Holy Spirit did, 
            because he appeared only in a voice, 
            which is not something visible, 
            but only audible, etc.
