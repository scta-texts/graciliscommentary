            Whether just as God is able 
            to make something please from what is not 
            while not giving it a lack of infused charity, 
            so he by himself able to make one dear 
            from what is not by withdrawing the rectitude of the human will; 
            whether just as God 
            is able to make one dear from what is not dear, 
            so he by himself is able to make one just from what is not just;
            whether just as God is able to make one pleasing 
            from what is not while not putting charity in the human mind, 
            so is he by himself able to make one dear from what is not 
            dear in removing the charity from an already possessed charity.
          </p>
          <div xml:id="pg-b1q18-Dd1e169" type="rationes-principales">

              Principal arguments
            </head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-qnpqda">
              That not in the first place 
              because, 
              if God is able to make something please 
              from what is not pleasing without such a habit, 
              then he is manifestly able to make something pleasing 
              from what is not that has this habit in itself. 
              The consequent is false. 
              Again, 
              it follows that God is able by himself alone 
              to make that a white thing is without producing whiteness 
              and that man exists without producing humanity, 
              which are false. 
              And the consequences are clear 
              because the argument does not seem to about one more than another.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e163">
              In the second place principally, 
              it would follow that God 
              would be able to be the formal ratio 
              making the will pleasing. 
              The consequence is clear, 
              the falsity is proved because, 
              if so, 
              then it follows 
              that it would be possible 
              there to be motion of ordered love 
              in the created mind. 
              The consequent is false 
              since motion indicates an imperfection.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e173">
              In the third place, 
              if God were able to 
              withdraw rectitude from the mind, 
              it follows that it would be able to make 
              a sinning mind. 
              The consequent is false 
              because no one is bad from God as author 
              according to  
              <cit>

                <bibl>Augustinus, XXX</bibl>
              </cit>.
              The consequence is clear 
              because every mind lacking rectitude is unjust. 
              This seems to be the opinion of
              <cit>

              In opposition, 
              it is argued that the first part has already shown above, 
              but the second is proved 
              because rectitude and the will 
              are absolutely distinct things, 
              therefore God is able to separate one from the other.
              And as a consequence 
              he is able possible to separate and remove 
              the will from its rectitude, 
              therefore.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e210">
              First conclusion: 
              though from the ordered law 
              no one is able to be pleasing <!-- review all translations of "pleasing" for carus, and consider accepted, beloved, dear, etc -->
              from what is not pleasing without infused charity, 
              nevertheless from the absolute or possible law 
              it is possible that the one not having this charity 
              is more greatly pleasing to God than another having it 
              and ordinately loves God with a greater intensity. 
              The first part is clear from what has been said. 
              The second part is proved 
              because the Holy Spirit alone actuates the mind 
              and elevates it to God for loving more intensely 
              than in fact a certain pilgrim 
              who has this habit of created charity 
              in the mind, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent was clear above. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e232">
              First corollary: 
              although concerning the common law 
              created charity is required for a pilgrim to be pleasing, <!-- to be acceptable ?? -->
              nevertheless no created charity is required 
              to act meritoriously to act well. 
              The first is apparent 
              because no one is pleasing without this habit. 
              The second part is proved 
              because 
              if any charity is given
              the pilgrim would be able to act meritoriously 
              with that created charity.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e245">
              The second corollary:
              any created mind eliciting a meritorious act of love 
              loves God infinitely more than 
              is absolutely necessary. 
              This is proved 
              both because it is not absolutely necessary 
              that the created mind loves God 
              and secondly 
              because the mind would be able to 
              <pb ed="#L" n="58-v"/> 
              love God meritoriously 
              with infinitely less charity or love.

              Third corollary: 
              the identity between whiteness and being white 
              is greater than 
              between created charity and being pleasing <!-- beloved -->. 
              This is clear 
              because nothing is able to be white without whiteness, 
              but it is possible to be pleasing <!-- beloved -->
              without this charity.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e291">
              The second conclusion: 
              though it is not repugnant to the Holy Spirit to be 
              a formal power by which the power meritoriously an act of love, 
              nevertheless it is repugnant to the Holy Spirit 
              to be for the created mind the motion of ordinate love. 
              The first is clear 
              because to be such a formal power indicates no imperfection, 
              indeed it indicates perfection and excludes everything repugnant, 
              as was seen above, therefore. 
              This is confirmed through

              The second is clear 
              because such motion indicates an imperfection, 
              namely potentiality, 
              but the Holy Spirit is the highest act
              excluding from itself every potentiality, 
              therefore.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e336">
              The first corollary: 
              this denomination of love should be more greatly applied 
              to the formal ratio 
              than to the vital motion of love. 
              This is clear 
              because this ratio per se and intrinsically 
              is called love, 
              but this motion is only called love extrinsically 
              because it is determined to this love.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e346">
              The second corollary: 
              that not every formal ratio of formal love a being of the highest perfection 
              is a mode of acting well or of meritorious loving 
              because the Holy Spirit is or is able to be 
              the ratio of this and not of motion.
            </p> 
            <p xml:id="pgb1q18-d1e354">
              Third corollary: 
              that the one having the meritorious motion of love 
              has the habit of charity is not necessary, 
              and conversely 
              it is not necessary that the one having 
              the habit of charity joined to the mind
              has the motion of love.
              This is clear through the conclusion, 
              and it is confirmed 
              because to the grace of predestination alone 
              corresponds the being of one meritorious <!-- needs translation check -->
              from the power of divine acceptance, therefore. 
              This was also made clear above.

              Third conclusion: 
              though God is able to introduce no latitude of guilt to human beings, 
              nevertheless God is able to remove the rectitude of the will from human beings. 
              The first part is clear 
              because then such a person would become worse 
              from God as author, 
              against 
              <cit>

              In the second case it is proved 
              because everything that is not the will 
              God is able to separate 
              and remove from it, 
              but the rectitude of the will is not the will, 
              therefore. 
              The major is known because everything
              that is absolutely distinct, 
              God etc.
              The minor is clear 
              because rectitude and the created will, 
              if they were the same, 
              it would follow that every created will 
              would be upright, 
              indeed it would further follows 
              that no will would be able to sine 
              because then every will would be formally 
              justice and rectitude, 
              which is false, 
              therefore.

              First corollary: 
              any absolute rectitude of a human will

            The first conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit works in us 
            an act of believing 
            and of spirating with mediating virtues, 
            namely with faith and hope. 
            But doctors put that the act of loving 
            which is operated in us without any the mediation of some virtue 
            or a created habit. 
            And note that
            <cit>
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q18-Rd1e645"><name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> here</ref>
              <bibl>Lombardus, I, d. 17, xxx</bibl>
            </cit> 
            seems to deny created charity, 
            therefore here it is commonly not held 
            because doctors assert that besides the act of loving 
            there is a created habit of charity. 
            But there are others who wish 
            <pb ed="#L" n="60-r"/> 
            to save the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            saying that the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            does not intend to deny this type of habit, 
            but I leave this to the judgment of the reader.

            The second conclusion:
            that through the gift of the Holy Spirit 
            gifts are given and divided, 
            for some individuals have all gifts, 
            but to other these gifts and others other gifts, 
            although all have this gift, 
            namely the Holy Spirit from whom 
            all gifts whatsoever are divided.
