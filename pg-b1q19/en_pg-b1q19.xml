            This is distinction 18 
            which continues the preceding thus 
            because after the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            discussed the temporal procession of the Holy Spirit, 
            now he discusses good things from a certain special property of it, <!-- unclear how to translation "bona" here; dbcheck --> 
            and this distinction is divided into five parts 
            according to which he introduces and answers five questions.
            For in the first place 
            it is asked whether the Holy Spirit 
            is a gift for the same reason in which it is give, <!-- translation check --> 
            second whether the Holy Spirit is properly given, 
            third whether while the Son is being born, 
            with the result that the essence is given, <!-- translation unclear -->
            fourth whether 
            because the Son is given to us 
            it is said to be ours, <!-- unclear about "noster" thats my best guess -->
            in the fifth place 
            whether the Holy Spirit 
            from the fact that it gives itself, 
            it is returned to itself.

                It is not essential

                to be a gift in the divine proceeds from the Father. 
                Nor is it notional 
                because the whole Trinity communicates itself 
                to cause these things, 
                saying,
                <cit>

                Then in the second place 
                because the ratio of the gift is love 
                which is essential.
                In the second place, 
                it follows that 
                no blessing obliges the creature more than before. 
                The consequent is false. 
                The consequence is clear 
                because nothing is greater than 
                an infinite obligation

              <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e192">
                In the second place principally, 
                if the question were true, 
                it would follow that nothing would be loveable, 
                nothing would be chooseable 
                unless by reason of this gift. 
                The consequent does not 
                seem true 
                because then no degree of loveability or chooseability 
                would correspond to natural being, 
                which is false. 
                The consequence is clear 
                because however good would be 
                that good as obligatory of the receiving creature 
                so it would be loveable and chooseable.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e205">
                In the third place, 
                it would follow that every thing receiving that gift
                would be equally obliged to God through itself. 
                The consequent is false 
                because 
                on account of the effect of the divine incarnation 
                and many other things belong to divine mercy, 
                the faithful are obliged more now 
                than before the reception of these blessings, 
                according to 
                <cit>
                  <ref xml:id="pg-b1q19-Rd1e236"><name>Gregory</name></ref>
                  <bibl>Gregorius Ariminensis, xxx</bibl>
                </cit>,
                for when gifts increase 
                the reasons behind the gifts also grow, 
                that is the obligations.
                The first consequence is clear 
                because all are obligated infinitely.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e227">
                In opposition, 
                it is argued a gift only obligates 
                as much as it profits the one to whom it is given, 
                but the immeasurable gift 
                benefits the person having it 
                more than if there were an infinity of created goods, 
                therefore.

                Second conclusion:
                it is not the case

                nevertheless a creature is not able to licitly 
                love itself as much as it ought to love God. 
                The first is clear 
                because [a creature cannot love something so great <!-- translation help needed -->

                The second is clear because

                This is clear because

                The second corollary:

                on account of something uncreated, 
                nevertheless the uncreated gift

                The first part is clear 
                through what has been said. 
                The second part is proved

                This is confirmed

                nevertheless nothing is able to for a creature

                Indeed, since 
                to sanctify a creature and to come to it is 
                and external work, 
                it follows that the whole Trinity 
                is given to the well disposed mind.
                This is confirmed 
                because the Father gives to the Son whatever he has, 
                indeed the Son is said to be given to us,
                therefore he is properly said to be a gift.

                The major is clear

                which nevertheless, 
                if they were had,

                Here it is said that 
                the consequence is not valid 
                because a majority of the ownership does not apply to the 
                greater licit habit of goods but to the possession.

                To the third, 
                it is clear that the faithful 
                after the incarnation 
                are more extensively obliged than before
                on account of the many benefits, 
                and thus often a creature is infinitely obliged, 
                just as it is said that Christ often merited the same prize, 
                otherwise he would have merited nothing through his death and passion 
                because he earned merit only in conception, 
                and not elsewhere, 
                therefore it is the same prize.

            The first conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit is said to be a gift from eternity 
            because it proceeds from eternity from the Father and the Son, 
            but it is said to be given from time 
            because it is given to creatures from time or temporally.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1486">
            Second conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit is said relatively to the Father and the Son 
            or referred to the Father and the Son 
            because the Spirit is of the Father and of the Son. 
            But this relation does not appear in this name <mentioned>Spirit</mentioned>, 
            but in the name <mentioned>gift</mentioned>.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1494">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the property by which the Holy Spirit or gift is called 
            is this procession by which it proceeds from eternity 
            from the Father and the Son as gift 
            or as giveable or donatable. 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1505">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that the Son proceeds from the Father 
            as begotten or as gift or giveale, 
            but the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son 
            not as begotten but only as gift or giveable, 
            nevertheless in a different way than the Son 
            because the procession of the Son is birth, 
            but the procession of the Holy Spirit 
            is not nativity nor genitive, 
            nevertheless each is ineffable. 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1515">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that just as the Son receives being from the Father, 
            non only as Son but in its entirety, 
            so also the Holy Spirit 
            by proceeding from the Father and the Son 
            receives being not only as Holy Spirit 
            but in its entirety, 
            nevertheless it does not receive this from 
            that by virtue of which it was give 
            because it was not given except in time.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1530">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that from the Father 
            generation comes before the essence in the Son, 
            not because the Son essence is Son
            but by the birth only, 
            but because by being born 
            it has the same essence which is in the Father.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1536">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that the procession from the Father and the Son 
            comes before and communicates the essence to the Holy Spirit 
            not because the Holy Spirit essence 
            is Holy Spirit but a personal property, 
            but because by properly proceeding 
            it has the same entire essence 
            which is in the Father and the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1546">
            Eight conclusion: 
            The Holy Spirit according to this which is eternally gift 
            is referred to the Father and the Son, 
            but according to what is said given and donated 
            it is referred to him 
            which gave and to those to whom it was given, 
            such that it is said to be our Spirit 
            when we receive it.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1554">
            Ninth conclusion: 
            that the Son is said to be our bread, 
            our redeemer and so on about many other similar things 
            which in some mode suit it, 
            but nevertheless it is not called <mentioned>our Son</mentioned>
            but is of the Father only 
            because the Son is said only relatively 
            to that which generated it, 
            but inasmuch as it is given to us 
            it is referred to God 
            who gave and to those to whom it was given.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q19-d1e1568">
            Afterwards 
            he asks whether the Holy Spirit 
            is referred to itself 
            just as it is given from itself, 
            but this he does not wish to solve here,
            but rather below in other distinctions.
