            This is distinction 40 in which,
            after the

              That not because no one is predestined eternally, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              both because someone is able to begin to be predestined, 
              and because 
              it follows that 
              the number of predestined would not be able to be increased, 
              and again because 
              it follows that 
              someone would be written in the book of life 
              in an irremovable way. 
              The falsity of the consequent is clear through

              The consequence is clear 
              because every eternal thing is unchangeable.

              In the second principal place, 
              it is repugnant that  
              someone predestined be damned in an ultimate way, 
              therefore. <!-- it cannot be revealed to them etenerally that they are damned -->
              The antecedent is proved because 
              it would follow that 
              someone would be predestined and not predestined. 
              Again in the second place 
              because 
              the God being would seem changed 
              when he wished to save them and does not save them. 
              Again in the third place 
              because it follows 
              that the Sacred Scriptures will be false 
              which say that the predestined will be saved.

              to someone predestined or existing in charity, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because 
              then there eternal damnation 
              <pb ed="#L" n="96-r"/>
              would occur necessarily;

              and again because then

              Again, 
              this is confirmed 
              because divine predestination is 
              the cause of predestined salvation, 
              therefore the cause of those things 
              which are required for reaching this end.
              But predestination is 
              also preparation or eternal volition, 
              such that the predestined 
              in time is justified, preserved, 
              obeys, believes, preserves, 
              and this is most especially true in the case of adults.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e3343">
              First corollary: 
              just as it is impossible 
              that God now in the first place 
              determines that something is future, 
              so it is impossible 
              that God begins to predestine. 
              This is clear 
              because he predestines eternally.
              This is confirmed 
              because, 
              if he were to begin etc, 
              then it would follows that 
              <c>a</c> was before this instance, 
              and consequently 
              in this instant it was future, 
              that is in some preceding instant.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e3379">
              Second corollary: 
              though God is able to foreknow more future things
              than he foreknows to be future, 
              nevertheless he is not able to know more future things
              than he knows that he knows, 
              and properly he is not able
              to increase the number of 
              known things, foreknown things, or predestined things.
              The first is clear 
              having supposed that the number of future things is certain
              and finite 
              because he is able to wish that there is some future thing 
              beyond any foreknown future thing 
              and he is able to know 
              that this future is.
              The second part is proved 
              because God is 
              the comprehensive actual knowledge of all things, 
              therefore it is not possible that there are more things to know. 
              The third part is proved 
              because, 
              if this were the case, 
              the following copulative would be able 
              to be verified at the same time, 
              here the number of people to be saved 
              contains more unities than before 
              and before did not contain fewer, 
              which is false.
              The consequence is clear 
              because this is properly 
              to increase the number, 
              therefore it is clear that, 
              just as the number of knowable things is not able to increase, 
              so the number of the elect is not able to be intensified.

              God is able to never wish or never have wished

              This is clear because

              This is clear because otherwise

              First corollary: 
              though someone predestined 
              is able to see in the word 
              that he will damned in the end, 
              nevertheless if it is revealed to him, 
              then he will be damned contingently and not otherwise. 
              The first is clear because, 
              from the conclusion,
              when taking <mentioned>predestined</mentioned> loosely,
              someone will predestined will be damned. 
              <!-- break -->
              In the second place, 
              this part is proved in the divided sense 
              because one predestined to glory 
              is able be damned 
              since their being saved is contingent. 
              But that this would be able to be revealed 
              is clear because 
              it is not any more repugnant 
              that the penalty be revealed 
              to the predestined than the guilt. 
              But de facto 
              <name>Christ</name>
              revealed to
              <name ref="#JudasIscariot">Judas</name> 
              and <name ref="#Peter">Peter</name> 
              their guilt, 
              therefore it was possible to reveal to <name>Judas</name> 
              his penalty, 
              and consequently his eternal damnation. 
              But it would be able to be said 
              that this is not similar 
              because damnation is not repugnant to predestination, 
              though it is repugnant to an effectu of damnation, 
              namely of grace. 
              But the infernal punishment 
              is repugnant on account of its property, 
              not only to the effect of predestination,
              but also to predestination itself
              because the following are incompatible, 
              <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name> is predestined 
              and <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name> will be eternally tormented.
              Therefore perhaps it would be said 
              that it does not follow, 
              God is able to reveal guilt, 
              therefore he is able to reveal punishment.
              But against this it is argued
              that final perseverance in mortal sin
              <unclear>de directo</unclear> is repugnant to predestination,

              This is confirmed,

              but this is something God can reveal, 
              as is clear through the preceding texts.
              The second part of the corollary 
              is proved 
              because for God to say or reveal 
              something evident outside himself 
              does not necessitate the future occurrence of something, 
              any more than his saying something within himself 
              that is immeasurably evident and certain, 
              but this saying within himself does not necessitate, 
              as is clear through the  
              <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>, 
              therefore.

              and the minor is in

              Second corollary: 
              God is not only able to reveal 
              damnation to someone conditionally, 
              but he is also able to reveal 
              this to the one to be damned 
              absolutely categorically.
              This is clear through the 
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q32-Rd1e811">first corollary</ref>

              <pb ed="#L" n="97-r"/>
              Third corollary: 
              just as with the evidence of something revealed 
              stands the contingency of the same thing, 
              so
              the evidence of this revelation is able to be had
              without pain or sadness, 
              or 
              it is the case 
              that one sees their own damnation 
              and to have no displeasure about this.
              The first is clear 
              because 
              with the blessed's clear vision of future damnation 
              it stands that this occurs contingently 
              and that it is possible to never occur. 
              The second part is clear 
              because 
              the one to whom such a revelation occurs 
              would also see 
              that it would be able not to occur, 
              or at least he out to believe this, 
              and thus would be able to hope for the grace of God 
              and would not be obligated to despair. 
              From this it is clear that, 
              if such a person will with certainty be damned, 
              though God would concur to the entity for the act of believing, 
              nevertheless he would not concur to such believing effectively 
              though perhaps he would improperly and objectively. 
              From what has been said 
              <!-- break? -->
              the response to the question is clear 
              because, 
              though God is not able to make the predestined 
              certain about his damnation in the word
              nevertheless 
              it is possible  
              that he see his own damnation clear and certainly in the word.
              The first part 
              because then God 
              would make him believe with certainty that he is damned,
              and thus God 
              would be able to force him to sin, 
              which is false.
              Second part is proved 
              because he is able to him 
              the dignity of eternal life 
              and the appropriate culpability of punishment, 
              therefore etc.

              This is clear because

              Again, 
              it should be known that

              revealed to the same person.
              This is clear

              To the second,

              The reason is because 
              damnation is not as formally 
              repugnant to grace 
              as to predestination
              on account of permanence of miser and glory

            The first conclusion of this distinction 40: 
            predestination is preparation of grace 
            for achieving salvation. 
            Whence there is double effect of predestination, 
            a temporal one in this life, 
            namely the infusion of grace
            another in eternal heavenly life, 
            namely the collection of glory. <!-- trans. check; collection for collatio?? -->
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e4494">
            The second conclusion: 
            when someone is said to be predestined,
            it is true that they are not able to be damned,
            if taken in the conjoined sense. 
            But if taken in the divided sense, 
            then it is false 
            because the predestined 
            is able not to be predestined, 
            and thus to be damned.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e4514">
            Third conclusion: 
            that just as God was able from eternity 
            to not predestine someone, 
            so it is conceded by some that 
            God is now also able not to have predestined this person, 
            therefore this person is able not to have been predestined
            nor now be predestined. 
            But if they had not been predestined 
            and were not now predestined,
            then consequently they are also <!-- translation check on punctuation and "also" for "et" -->
            now able not to be predestined. 
            And it similarly able to be said 
            about the foreknowledge and the foreknown.
            Nevertheless
            in the actions of creatures 
            this is not conceded 
            because what has been done or said by a creature 
            is impossible not to have been done or said
            when relating to the possibility or impossibility 
            of the existing thing to nature.
            But when it is done 
            from the foreknowledge or predestination of God,
            possibility and impossibility is related to the punishment of God,
            which is always the same and always was the same.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e4545">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            condemnation is the foreknowledge of iniquity 
            of some people and the preparation of damnation 
            for those same people,
            nevertheless 
            he does so because he foreknows the iniquity
            but he does not prepare it,
            however he foreknows and prepares an eternal penalty
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q32-d1e4568">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that just as the effect of predestination 
            is the operation of grace, 
            so the effect of eternal condemnation 
            is in some way or seems to be stubbornness, <!-- translation check "stubbornness for "obduratio" -->
            nevertheless God does not cause someone to be stubborn 
            by imparting or by sending malice,
            but rather by not imparting grace. 
            And these things suffice.
