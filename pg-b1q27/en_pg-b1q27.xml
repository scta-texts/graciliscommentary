            determined about the comparison of properties belonging to each person, 
            here he considers the comparison of persons to the essence.
            And this is divided into two parts 
            because in the first place he makes determinations about comparisons of this type,

            And this is divided into three parts,

              that nothing would precede it. 
              The consequent is false 
              because being precedes living, 
              and living precedes understanding and knowing 
              in creatures,

              In the second place,

              The consequent seems false,

              The consequent seems false 
              because then the direct act 
              would not be prior 
              nor more perfect than 
              the reflexive act.

                  which are in the knowledge of them
                  he sees each at the same time,

                  as if seen alternatively, 
                  but he sees all things at once

            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3270">
              First corollary: 
              the divine will does not make possible the possible 
              before the possible itself is or exists 
              or before the divine intellect understands it. 
              This is clear 
              because otherwise 
              it would follow 
              that the divine will 
              would be the cause of the possibility of sin, 
              which is false.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3278">
              Second corollary: 
              just as nothing is able to precede the divine science, 
              so nothing is able to exist as the cause of the divine science. 
              This is clear 
              because it is eternal,
              and because the name of <mentioned>cause</mentioned> 
              is not admitted in the divine,
              and because the science of God 
              <pb ed="#L" n="83-r"/>
              in an instant of eternity.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3292">
              Third corollary: 
              though the divine science 
              is terminated cognitively to every intelligible thing, 
              nevertheless not every intelligible thing depends effectively on God.
              This is clear 
              because God would be the cause of 
              any possibility and impossibility, 
              and in this case God is the prior cause of the impossibility
              of his own non existence, 
              which is false 
              because nothing is the cause of this.

              Second conclusion: 
              though no created thing is able to be 
              actual science of anything probable 
              from itself or another, 
              nevertheless God is all knowledge of 
              any complex or incomplex knowable thing.
              The first part is proved 
              because concerning anything 
              there are infinite knowable truths, 
              therefore.
              The consequence holds 
              because no created thing 
              is able to know distinctly
              at the same time
              infinite truths. 
              The antecedent 
              is proved 
              because regarding anything 
              there are infinite knowable propositions 
              in connection with <!-- loose translation of "inter et" -->
              other existing or possible things 
              without end.
              The second part 
              is clear through the first conclusion.
              Again, 
              this is clear through

              or it is the case that 
              the intellect is a thing known intuitively 
              and its knowledge is not terminated in such a thing.
              This is clear 
              because the divine intellect knows 
              all things eternally and intuitively in itself, 
              just as in the exemplative art of those things,

              Third conclusion: 
              the divine essence knows itself 
              and other things distinct from itself
              equally first and with an equally immeasurably perfect knowledge.
              This is clear 
              because from eternity 
              it knew all things, 
              therefore it did so equally first.
              The consequence is valid, 
              and the antecedent is proved 
              because God does not ever begin to know anew 
              and he is not able to begin to know. 
              But that he knows with 
              an equally perfect knowledge 
              is clear because 
              his essence is his knowledge 
              and his knowing is his being,

              First corollary:

              distinct beings distinctly, 
              so he knows reflexively 
              no produced or producible thing.
              This is clear 
              because every divine cognition 
              is correct in highest way,
              but reflexive cognition

              This is clear because

              is in no way made deficient from its proper immensity.
              This is clear 
              because the divine intellect 
              while knowing the essence 
              apprehends it while comprehending adequately, 
              but the formally immeasurable divine essence

              Against the third conclusion,

              in some way is an object to the divine cognitive power,

              exceeds the multitude of all things known, 
              therefore God does not know all things distinctly.
              The consequence is valid,
              and the antecedent is proved as follows:
              let <c>a</c> be the whole multitude of possible angels known by God, 
              and let <c>b</c> be the multitude of all souls,

              and let <c>d</c> be the composed multitude of <c>b</c> and <c>c</c> only, 
              then it is argued thus that <c>a</c> is equal to <c>b</c> et <c>c</c> separately, 
              therefore <c>a</c> is less than <c>d</c>, 
              therefore <c>a</c> is able to be imagined to grow to equality with <c>d</c>, 
              by which fact God does not thus know distinctly 
              the whole multitude of <c>a</c> which has been increased, 
              therefore the whole multitude of all known things 
              is exceeded by the multitude of all knowable things.

              The antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              if to this multitude of points 
              one point were added, 
              then this would not have been the multitude of all knowlable points.
              And the consequence is clear

              because something is not <unclear>therefore</unclear> called omnipotent

            </cit>. 
            The first conclusion of distinction 34: 
            that the three divine persons are distinguished by properties, 
            and are the same according to essence, 
            such that the three persons 
            are at the same time one God and one essence 
            and individual somethings.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4137">
            Second conclusion: 
            that when it is said, 
            the Son is what the Father is, 
            it is understood according to substance, 
            but not according to 
            that which is said in relation to the other. <!-- "in relation to the other = ad aliud" -->
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4143">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the use of the holy doctors 
            admits this saying, 
            the essence of the three persons is one, 
            and the three persons are of one essence, 
            but it is never ready in scripture 
            that there is one God of three persons
            or three persons of one God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4157">
            The fourth conclusion: 
            just as the essence is said about God
            according to substance, 
            so goodness, wisdom, power, 
            and those things that are said about God according to substance 
            are at the same time said about the three persons
            and about them individually.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4165">
            The fifth conclusion: 
            that the one of the three persons 
            is power, wisdom, and goodness, <!-- translation check -->
            and the three persons are 
            the same power, 
            the same wisdom, 
            and the same goodness.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4173">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that though these are the same inwardly, 
            nevertheless 
            power is attributed to the Father,
            wisdom to the Son, 
            and goodness to the Holy Spirit,
            so that it not be thought that the 
            Father is impotent, 
            the Son less wise, 
            and the Holy Spirit
            puffed up or timid or cruel.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4181">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that the Son is understood to be <foreign>homoousion</foreign>, 
            that consubstantial, with the Father, 
            whence the Son is called <foreign>homoousion</foreign> to the Father, 
            that is of one same substance,
            and thus the Father is likewise said to be omnipotent.

            Eight conclusion: 
            that names said transumptively about God, 
            like mirror, splendor, character, and similar names, 
            are sad by reason of some similarity, 
            such that hearing this  
            some catholic understanding about God is understood. <!-- translation check -->

            First conclusion of distinction 35: 
            that the divine science, 
            while it is one and simple,
            nevertheless on account of the varied state of things
            and diverse effects, 
            is referred to with diverse words
            because sometimes it is called 
            foreknowledge, 
            disposition,
            providence,
            predestination
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4221">
            Second conclusion: 
            that providence or foreknowledge 
            is only with respect to future things, 
            both about good things and about bad things. 
            Disposition is only about things to be done. 
            Predestination is about people who should be saved 
            and the goods in which these <!-- translation/grammar/transcription on haec vs hii -->  
            are freed from the guilt 
            and penalty and in the future will be crowned in glory. 
            Providence is about things to be governed 
            and sometimes understood as foreknowledge, 
            but wisdom and science are about all things bad and good; 
            past, present, and future; temporal and eternal.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4233">
            Third conclusion: 
            that foreknowledge, 
            predestination, 
            and disposition,
            inasmuch <unclear>as they are</unclear>, <!-- translation check; not sure how to use ad illud quod; should contrast with "inasmuch as they convey a relation to the future.." below-->  
            would remain and would be, 
            even if it were supposed that there were no future 
            because they are nothing other than the divine essence. 
            But inasmuch as they convey a relation to the future, 
            they would then not remain
            if there were no future

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4245">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that if there were no future, 
            there would still be knowledge in God
            just as there is now <!-- using "modo" as currently/presentionly -->
            because knowledge is not only about temporal things, 
            but also about eternal things, 
            and it would not be less nor more than it is at present.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4253">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that all things were in God 
            from eternity, 
            nor did God know created things  
            differently than things to be created,<!-- translation check --> 
            and all things are said to be alive in God, 
            not because the creature is the creator 
            or because these corruptible things are essentially in God, 
            but because they are in his knowledge which is life
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4268">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that both the past and the future 
            are present in God 
            because they are in him 
            by some ineffable cognition of his wisdom.
