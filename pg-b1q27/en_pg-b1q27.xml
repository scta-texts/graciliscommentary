            determined about the comparison of properties belonging to each person, 
            here he considers the comparison of persons to the essence.
            And this is divided into two parts 
            because in the first place he makes determinations about comparisons of this type,

            And this is divided into three parts,

            is eternal cogitative knowledge of any knowable thing; 
            whether the uncreated essence of every knowable thing

              That not

              if knowledge of God were eternal, 
              it would follow 
              that nothing would precede it. 
              The consequent is false 
              because being precedes living, 
              and living precedes understanding and knowing 
              in creatures, 
              therefore also in the creator.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3187">
              In the second place, 
              if God were to know all things, 
              it follows that his knowledge would terminate in something external.
              The consequent seems false,

              In the third place,

              would not know himself 
              before he knows created or creatable things. 
              The consequent seems false 
              because then the direct act 
              would not be prior 
              nor more perfect than 
              the reflexive act.

              This conclusion is clear through

                  which are in the knowledge of them
                  he sees each at the same time, 
                  not as particulars or individually
                  as if seen alternatively, 
                  but he sees all things at once

            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3270">
              First corollary: 
              the divine will does not make possible the possible 
              before the possible itself is or exists 
              or before the divine intellect understands it. 
              This is clear 
              because otherwise 
              it would follow 
              that the divine will 
              would be the cause of the possibility of sin, 
              which is false.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3278">
              Second corollary: 
              just as nothing is able to precede the divine science, 
              so nothing is able to exist as the cause of the divine science. 
              This is clear 
              because it is eternal,
              and because the name of <mentioned>cause</mentioned> 
              is not admitted in the divine,
              and because the science of God 
              <pb ed="#L" n="83-r"/>
              in an instant of eternity.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e3292">
              Third corollary: 
              though the divine science 
              is terminated cognitively to every intelligible thing, 
              nevertheless not every intelligible thing depends effectively on God.
              This is clear 
              because God would be the cause of 
              any possibility and impossibility, 
              and in this case God is the prior cause of the impossibility
              of his own non existence, 
              which is false 
              because nothing is the cause of this.

              Second conclusion: 
              though no created thing is able to be 
              actual science of anything probable 
              from itself or another, 
              nevertheless God is all knowledge of 
              any complex or incomplex knowable thing.
              The first part is proved 
              because concerning anything 
              there are infinite knowable truths, 
              therefore.
              The consequence holds 
              because no created thing 
              is able to know distinctly
              at the same time
              infinite truths. 
              The antecedent 
              is proved 
              because regarding anything 
              there are infinite knowable propositions 
              in connection with <!-- loose translation of "inter et" -->
              other existing or possible things 
              without end.
              The second part 
              is clear through the first conclusion.
              Again, 
              this is clear through

              First corollary: 
              the intellect is a thing known intuitively

              or it is the case that 
              the intellect is a thing known intuitively 
              and its knowledge is not terminated in such a thing.
              This is clear 
              because the divine intellect knows 
              all things eternally and intuitively in itself, 
              just as in the exemplative art of those things,

              Third conclusion:

              because from eternity 
              it knew all things, 
              therefore it did so equally first.
              The consequence is valid, 
              and the antecedent is proved

              his essence is his knowledge

              This is clear 
              because the divine intellect

            </cit>. 
            The first conclusion of distinction 34: 
            that the three divine persons are distinguished by properties, 
            and are the same according to essence, 
            such that the three persons 
            are at the same time one God and one essence 
            and individual somethings.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4137">
            Second conclusion: 
            that when it is said, 
            the Son is what the Father is, 
            it is understood according to substance, 
            but not according to 
            that which is said in relation to the other. <!-- "in relation to the other = ad aliud" -->
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4143">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the use of the holy doctors 
            admits this saying, 
            the essence of the three persons is one, 
            and the three persons are of one essence, 
            but it is never ready in scripture 
            that there is one God of three persons
            or three persons of one God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4157">
            The fourth conclusion: 
            just as the essence is said about God
            according to substance, 
            so goodness, wisdom, power, 
            and those things that are said about God according to substance 
            are at the same time said about the three persons
            and about them individually.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4165">
            The fifth conclusion: 
            that the one of the three persons 
            is power, wisdom, and goodness, <!-- translation check -->
            and the three persons are 
            the same power, 
            the same wisdom, 
            and the same goodness.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4173">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that though these are the same inwardly, 
            nevertheless 
            power is attributed to the Father,
            wisdom to the Son, 
            and goodness to the Holy Spirit,
            so that it not be thought that the 
            Father is impotent, 
            the Son less wise, 
            and the Holy Spirit
            puffed up or timid or cruel.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4181">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that the Son is understood to be <foreign>homoousion</foreign>, 
            that consubstantial, with the Father, 
            whence the Son is called <foreign>homoousion</foreign> to the Father, 
            that is of one same substance,
            and thus the Father is likewise said to be omnipotent.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4195">
            Eight conclusion: 
            that names said transumptively about God, 
            like mirror, splendor, character, and similar names, 
            are sad by reason of some similarity, 
            such that hearing this  
            some catholic understanding about God is understood. <!-- translation check -->

            Prima conclusio distinctionis 35: 
            quod scientia 
            divina cum sit una et simplex,
            tamen propter varios rerum status 
            et diversos effectus 
            diversa sortitur vocabula 
            quia quandoque dicitur 
            praescientia, 
            dispositio, <!-- dbcheck dispositio -->

            Secunda conclusio: 
            quod providentia seu praescientia 
            est tantum respectu futurorum sed tam de bonis 
            quam de malis dispositio est tantum 
            de faciendis praedestinatio de hominibus salvandis et 
            de bonis quibus haec liberantur a culpa 
            et pena et in futuro coronabuntur in gloria 
            providentia est gubernandorum

            Tertia conclusio: 
            quod praescientia praedestinatio 
            et dispositio quantum ad illud 
            quod sunt manerent et essent 
            posito quod nullum esset futurum

            Quarta conclusio: 
            quod si nulla esset 
            futura adhuc in Deo esset scientia quae modo est 
            quia scientia non solum est de temporalibus 
            sed etiam de aeternis nec esset minor nec maior quam modo.

            Quinta conclusio:

            Deo ab aeterno nec aliter novit Deus res factans 
            quam <sic>fiendas</sic> et dicuntur omnia esse 
            in Deo vita non quod creatura sit creator

          <p xml:id="pgb1q27-d1e4268">
            Sexta conclusio: 
            quod tam praeterita
