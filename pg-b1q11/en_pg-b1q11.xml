            This is the tenth distinction which is continued to the preceding thus
            because after the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined 
            about the generation of the Son, 
            now  
            <pb ed="#L" n="39-r"/> 
            he begins to treat about the procession of the Holy Spirit. 
            And he divides this in tow parts 
            because in the first place he determines 
            about its mode of procession, 
            in the second place about its productive principle. 
            The second begins in the beginning of the distinction 11,

          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e117">
            The first is divided in two 
            because in the first place 
            he shows how the Holy spirit proceeds 
            or is produced, 
            in the second place 
            why it is expressed only by a common name.

            </cit>.
            The first is divided into two because he first shows the mode by which he proceeds or emanates,
            secondly he confirms what he says with authorities.

            Distinction 11 follows 
            in which after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            explained in the preceding the procession of the Holy Spirit, 
            here regarding this he explains the double operation,
            which indeed is why
            distinction 11 is divided into two parts. 
            For in the first place the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> shows 
            the agreement of the Latins, 
            in the second place he shows the disagreement of the Greeks. 
            The second part begins at

            The first part is divided into two 
            because in the first place the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>

            In the second place he ads his proof of what he said at

              That not 
              because then it follows in the first place that 
              it is only repugnant that the Holy Spirit is not produced by the Son 
              just as it is not distinguished from it.
              The consequent is false 
              because if, through the impossible, 
              the Son were not to produce the Holy Spirit, 
              this distinction between them would still exist, 
              therefore. 
              The first consequence is proved because, 
              if in the same mode, the Father and Son spirate,
              then therefore the Father spirates in such a way that, 
              if he were not to spirate the Holy Spirit, 
              it would not be said to be from him. 
              It follows that, if the Son also does not spirate, 
              then it would also be distinguished.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e201">
              In the second place, 
              that the Son does not spirate the Holy Spirit 
              is proved by the authority of
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q11-Rd1e251" corresp="#pg-b1q11-Qd1e258">
                <name ref="#JohnDamascenus">Damascene</name>, in book one, chapters 10 and 11</ref>,

              </cit>.
              Therefore, if it is not from the Son, 
              it does not seem to precede from him.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e216">
              In the third place, 
              if this is true, 
              it would follow that it would naturally proceed from them.
              The consequent is false because 
              it proceeds in the mode of love and of liberty or of the will.
              But the consequence is proved 
              because internally there is a single mode of proceeding in the divine 
              that cannot be made into a plurality 
              as was said above. 
              But the Son proceeds from the Father in a natural mode or naturally, 
              therefore, if the Holy Spirit proceeds from something,
              this will be naturally and not freely.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e244">
              First conclusion: though the Holy Spirit 
              does not proceed from the Father prior or more greatly than from the Son, 
              nevertheless that the Spirit is or proceeds from something  
              is only able to be shown by means of faith.
              The first part is proved 
              because for each sign the Holy Spirit is spirated from the Son, 
              but for every sign for which it is spirated it is from the Father, 
              therefore for any sign spirated by the Father 
              for the same sign it is spirated by thed Son.
              The major premise is clear because,
              if the opposite were given,
              it follows that in some sign 
              the Holy Spirit would from one only 
              and not from two, 
              contradicting the faith.
              The second, namely, the minor, is proved 
              because for each for which there is active spiration, 
              there is also passive spiration, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because otherwise it would follow 
              that the Father some sign would spirate the Holy Spirit
              for which sign the Holy Spirit would not be spirated, 
              which is a contradiction.
              The second part of the conclusion is proved 
              because it would follow 
              that the Trinity of the divine persons 
              would be able to be shown by evident reason, 
              which is false as has been proven.
              Again, 
              every argument short of faith 
              proving that the Holy Spirit proceeds would prove 
              that the Holy Spirit produces another Holy Spirit, 
              just as was said about the generation of the Son. <!-- cross reference here ?? --> 
              But that it is able to be shown by means of fatih is clear from

              The first corollary: 
              just as the Father does not speak
              <pb ed="#L" n="39-v"/>
              the Word earlier than he spirates the Holy Spirit, 
              so the generation of the Divine Word is not really prior 
              to the spiration of the Holy Spirit. 
              The first is clear because 
              the Son is not prior to the Holy Spirit, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              just as it is proved that 
              the Father is not prior to the Son, 
              so it is proved that the Son 
              is not prior to the Holy Spirit.
              The second part is proved 
              because in the divine 
              there is no real priority in quo <!-- "in quo" is a technical phrase --> 
              as it has been proved.
              Likewise if generation preceded spiration, 
              it would follow that 
              what is generated would precede what is spirated, 
              which has been disproved.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e341">
              The second corollary:
              that in God the Son produces the Holy Spirit causally 
              because it exists as <!-- dbcheck translation of "as" --> 
              its express image and perfect likeness.
              This is clear because by the same reason
              it would be proved that the Holy Spirit produces the Son, 
              therefore.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e355">
              Third corollary: 
              not precisely from the fact that 
              since the Son is God 
              the Son spirates or produces the Holy Spirit.
              This is clear 
              because it would be proved 
              that the Holy Spirit would produces its very self 
              or another that is the Son.
              And the consequence is clear 
              because it is no less God 
              that the Father or the Son is.

              Second conclusion: 
              though nothing other than active spiration 
              is distinctive of the Holy Spirit from the Son 
              nevertheless the following is not a formal consequence
              <mentioned>the Holy Spirit is not produced by the Son, 
                therefore the Son is not distinguished from the Holy Spirit</mentioned>.
              The first part is proved 
              because nothing is in the Son 
              that is not active spiration, 
              therefore. 
              In the second place, 
              because if it were distinguished through something else, 
              it follows that the Son would not be most simple. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because there are many incomplex entities in it.
              The second part is proved 
              because the Son is not precisely distinguished from the Holy Spirit 
              because he precisely spirate it, 
              therefore the consequnence is not formal. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because in this consequence 
              it is argued from causes of truth to one, 
              but such a consequence is not valid. 
              But the principal antecedent 
              is argued because the Son is distinguished 
              sufficiently form the Holy Spirit 
              through the fact that he proceeds from the Father 
              by being born and the Holy Spirit does not, 
              but only by proceeding. 
              This argument is also confirmed by 
              the saying of

              therefore 
              the Holy Spirit is not the
              Son though both come from the father

              The first corollary: 
              The relative opposition alone is not distinctive of the divine persons.
              This is clear 
              because, 
              if there were no opposition of this type between the Son and the Holy Spirit, 
              they would still be distinguished through the conclusion. 
              This is confirmed because the divine persons are distinguished in themselves

              which it is proved in the first place 
              because, 
              if there were one principle spirating the Holy Spirit, 
              then there would be some fourth person in the divine, 
              since the neither the Father nor the Son is this 
              one principle.
              <!-- paragraph break ?? -->
              In the second place, 
              it follows that there are only two persons there.
              This is proved because 
              there is only the spirative principle and 
              and spirated principle or the terminus of spiration.
              <!-- paragraph break ?? -->
              In the third place, 
              it follows that the Father and Son are 
              somehow one,
              and the Holy Spirit would it not be one in this way.
              The consequent is false, 
              and the consequence is clear 
              because the Father and the Son are one principle of the Holy Spirit, 
              but the Holy Spirit is not thus one with them, therefore.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because otherwise it would follow int he first place 
              that the same indivisible terminus with a single relation 
              would be referred to many. 
              In the second place, that one and the same thing could be produced absolutely 
              from many total causes was disproved above.
              In the third place, 
              it follows that the effect depends on a cause, 
              which when removed, nothing less would be produced. 
              This is false, therefore.

              If the first,

            This distinction contains
            four conclusions.
            The first is that the Holy Spirit 
            is the love or charity or delight of the Father and the Son
            by which the Father and the Son love each other and us.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1590">
            Second conclusion: 
            that love sometimes refers to a substance which 
            is common to three persons total in each individual, 
            sometimes specially to the person of the Holy Spirit, 
            just as the divine wisdom 
            is sometimes take for the divine substance, 
            and sometimes take for the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1598">
            Third conclusion: 
            just as the Holy Spirit in the Trinity 
            means specifically the charity 
            which is the union of the Father and the Son, 
            so also the name holds rightly that 
            it commonly somehow applies to the Father and the Son.

            etc. 
            This distinction 11 contains four conclusions.
            The first is that the Holy Spirit proceeds 
            from the Father and the Son according to the Latin doctors 
            and according to the truth 
            which is proved through the testimony of many doctors and Holy Scripture.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1617">
            Second conclusion:
            though the Greeks and confess and conceded that the Holy Spirit is the spirit of the Son, 
            nevertheless they say that the Holy Spirit 
            only proceeds from the Father and not from the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1625">
            Third conclusion: when it is said
            <cit>
              <quote xml:id="pg-b1q11-Qd1e1315" source="http://scta.info/resource/pll1d11c1-d1e3592">

            </cit>,
            this should be understood as,
            anyone who preached in a mode opposite or contrary  
            is anathema.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1633">
            The fourth conclusion: 
            The Greeks conceding 
            that the Holy Spirit is the spirit of the Son 
            hold the same opinion with us in faith 
            because to say that it is the spirit of the Father or the Son 
            is nothing other than to say 
            that is or proceeds from the Father and the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q11-d1e1641">
            From this it seems to follow that the Greeks 
            only differ from us in word 
            because the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Son just as from the Father. 
            This is clear through many Greek doctors,
