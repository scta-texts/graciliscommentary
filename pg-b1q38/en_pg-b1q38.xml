            This is distinction 46 of the first book
            in which,

            <name xml:id="pg-b1q38-Nd1e120" ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            determined about the divine efficacy, 
            he considers some doubts about the things said.
            And it is divided into two parts 
            according to which the 
            <name xml:id="pg-b1q38-Nd1e123" ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            considers two questions, 
            for in the first place 
            he asks whether God wishes that something good
            that will not occur, 
            in the second place 
            whether he does not wish that something bad will occur 
            which nevertheless will occur.

              That not because, 
              if this were the case, 
              then it would follow that 
              the divine wishing
              would as much and as perfectly influence 
              and act for the production of one thing
              as for another, 
              indeed as much for the non-being of thing
              as for its production in being. 
              The consequent seems to be false.
              And the consequence is clear
              because everything that the divine willing 
              immediately produces for the production of this thing 
              infinitely concurs and influences. 
              This is clear 
              because its causality is 
              not able to be supplied by any second cause.

              In the second place, 
              it follows that the divine wishing 
              would be the per se cause of sin and deformity.
              The consequent is false.
              And the consequence is clear because, 
              if God is the causal principle 
              of the non-being of the grace of  
              <name xml:id="pg-b1q38-Nd1e203" ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name>,

              is in a state of cult.

              when everything else is removed
              formally has non-being, 
              this it does not have from another, 
              but it is the non-being of this thing, 
              therefore.
              The major is known. 
              The minor is apparent 
              because some creature 
              left to itself 
              does not having anything except non-being,

              it also has in itself 
              a principle

              The consequences is valid. 
              But the proof of the antecedent 
              is because, 
              if it were the case, <!-- that it had non being from itself -->
              then it would follows that non being 
              would be necessary non being, 
              and thus through no power 
              would be able to be put into being,

              First conclusion: 
              though the divine wishing is to act externally 
              and infinitely according to modes that are repugnant to creatures, 
              nevertheless it always externally in a finite way 
              according to conditions common to it and to a second cause.
              The first part is clear 
              because the divine willing <!-- wishing's above could be come "willing" but not "will" --> 
              acts independently with the principle of infinite perfection
              as the the first cause 
              without which another second cause is not able to act, 
              and to act in this way is repugnant to a second cause 
              no matter how much its perfection and activity is increased, 
              therefore this first part is true. 
              But the second part is proved 
              because to act with some finite effect 
              in finite time, with finite velocity 
              and with a sometimes greater and sometimes lesser effect 
              is evidence that something acts finitely. <!-- is evidence that for "arguit" -->
              But these conditions are suitable 
              to God and creatures when acting at the same time, 
              therefore.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q38-d1e3369" n="Corollarium 1">
              First corollary: 
              just it is not repugnant 
              that a creature according to various senses 
              finitely and infinitely loves God, 
              so it is not repugnant 
              that God according to various respects 
              influences externally 
              <pb ed="#L" n="115-v"/> 
              both finitely and infinitely. 
              The first part is proved 
              because the creature finitely loves God 
              when refering finitely to his power
              and to the act of loving,
              and nevertheless at the same time <!-- at the same time for "cum hoc" --> 
              loves God infinitely 
              according to appreciability and preference 
              because the creature prefers God over 
              an infinity of other created goods, 
              if such an infinity of goods existed.
              The second part is clear 
              through the conclusion and is proof.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q38-d1e3389" n="Corollarium 2">
              Second corollary: 
              though God does not act externally infinitely 
              according to an adequate termination 
              and according to the ultimate exhaustion of his virtual influence, 
              nevertheless he acts externally infinitely 
              according to the immensity of his cause, 
              as marks of his nobility and excellence.
              The first part is clear because, 
              if God were to act in the first mode, 
              it would follows that he would not 
              be able to do more or act in a more perfect way 
              intensively or extensively. 
              The consequent is false
              because for any given effect, 
              God is able to produce a more perfect effect.
              The second part 
              is proved because God is not only in himself 
              an absolute and formally infinite being, 
              but also acts in the mode of infinite excellence and eminence 
              because <supplied>he acts</supplied> independently 
              as the first efficient cause 
              ultimate end 
              and as having full omnipotence, 
              therefore.

              Third corollary: 
              though for any given or giveable effect 
              God is able to produce something more perfect, 
              nevertheless God as much as he is from his own part 
              is capable of the production of now effect more perfect 
              than what he concurs to concur.
              The first part is clear though what is said elsewhere. 
              The second part is proved from the conclusion 
              because God 
              as much as he is from his own part 
              always infinitely concurs 
              and does not generate his Son more perfectly 
              than he produces a fly
              when referring to the word 
              <mentioned>more perfectly</mentioned> 
              as the perfection of the producing principle.
              But if it were noted 
              the perfection of the preceding term, <!-- translation check needed here -->
              then it should be said that 
              he produces the Son infinitely more perfect 
              than man or an angel
              just as the Son is unproportionally 
              more perfect than an angel or a man.

              for the will of God is much better than the will of any wise man. 
              But it is the case that 
              it is possible 
              <!-- is possible for "convenit"; 
                fitting or suitable doesn't seem right, 
                because he is not trying to say that this is good for a creature, 
                merely that that is something that is possible for a human creature to do --> 
              for a wise man to effectively cause evil 
              by which someone evil is effected. <!-- need translation check for "quis efficiatur malus" -->
              The second part is proved 
              because however much more God wishes 
              that this positive act does not occur,
              nevertheless if the created will 
              wills that this occurs and produces this
              and does not obey God, 
              then God will not remove his general influence, 
              but leaves the will to its own liberty. 
              Whence just someone throwing merchandise 
              into the sea 
              does not will absolutely to throw away merchandise
              but only conditionally 
              because he would
              rather be deprived of reaches than his life, 
              so in the proposed.
              Again, 
              just as a father draws the ship with his son
              so that it does not remain in the river
              and nevertheless earlier prohibited the son 
              from moving, 
              when the son draws, 
              the father coacts, 
              nevertheless he does not properly will 
              that his son draws the ship, 
              indeed he is displeased 
              even though he coacts with the son, 
              so in the proposed 
              God wills evil acts 
              with a mixture of involuntariness, 
              and concerning this mixture of the voluntary 
              with the involuntary 
              it is discussed in

              Second corollary: 
              therefore the divine will acts in evil things 
              because 
              the human will acts and not the reverse. 
              This is clear 
              because, 
              if this were the reverse
              it would follow that before the act 
              God would have pre-ordained it 
              and approved it through the law. 
              And thus with respect to this 
              it would have to be the case 
              that he willed this without 
              the admixture of any involuntariness, 
              which is against the conclusion.
              This is clear in the preceding example
              about the one drawing the ship 
              which is against the father's command,
              with whom the father draws the ship
              therefore because the son who is free 
              is entirely wishing to draw the ship.

              Third corollary: 
              though the divine willing 
              is not the cause of sin 
              or is not causing evil things, 
              nevertheless the divine willing 
              of an evil act or of sin 
              is an effective cause. 
              The first is clear 
              because otherwise it follows 
              that God would be the cause of evil as evil 
              and that evil would be evil 
              since it is from God, 
              which is false. 
              The consequence is clear

              <mentioned>evil</mentioned> or <mentioned>sin</mentioned>
              discussed in the aforesaid part
              names its own form. <!-- translation check --> 
              The second part is proved 
              because though 
              this it only denoted 
              that God is the cause of this thing which is sin, 
              and this is true

              From what has been said 
              it would be able to be inferred that, 
              just as defect or evilness in an act of the will 
              does not always come forth by reason of human cognition, 
              so the defect or evilness in the act of the will 
              never come forth from the divine volition or creation. 
              For a similar reason 
              it is clear that a defect in an offspring 
              sometimes happens due to the mother 
              and sometimes due to the father, 
              sometimes due to another influence ...
              and thus the defect is sometimes 
              attributed to one party and not to another. 
              Thus, 
              though God is the cause of defective act, 
              nevertheless he is not the cause of the defective act morally
              and nor should it be imputed to him inasmuch as it is defective.

              The second corollary:

              nevertheless he is able to be called the negative cause of actiong

              than with another and through one exchange than through another,
              therefore God also is able to create according to conflicting modes.
              The consequence holds 
              because God is freer than a human being or an angel. 
              And the antecedent is clear

              as has been said.

              it is said that God loves

              according to diverse 
              understandings of this express.

              but rather 
              sometimes on account of the failures of human beings 
              he permits their wills  
              to be inclined to this 
              and to be excited for these things
              and he permits occasions of sin and causes of sin
              and impediments of the good to be fulfilled
              either by man or by the devil,
              not by offering special help, 
              but by abandoning 
              by not reprimanding occasions of evil 
              and impediments of the good, 
              also sometimes by permitting 
              a greater power or license to the enemy.

              Again, 
              he inclines to evil 
              sometimes through accident or indirectly, 
              namely sometimes by conferring benefits 
              to a person 
              which are misused
              and when the person accepts the occasion for sin from the benefit 
              by which he ought to have accepted the occasion for 
              <pb ed="#L" n="118-v"/> 
              acting well.
              Again, 
              sometimes he administrates 
              or permits something to be administrated 
              to a bad person 
              that is occasionally able to incline him to sin, 
              nevertheless he does this 
              while preserving the liberty of that person.

              </cit>,
              it is said that 
              God will something occasionally 
              is able to be understood in three ways.
              In the first mode, 
              it is understood to be 
              on account of ignorance or uncertainty of the condition, 
              just as when we say,
              tomorrow I will do <c>c</c>
              if <c>b</c> will happen,
              and God does not will anything conditionally in this way. 
              In the second mode, 
              it is understood to be 
              on account of some non-willing or disapproval and displeasure of the condition, 
              just as when someone wishes to throw money in to the sea
              if they are in danger, 
              and in this sense 
              God is said to will positive acts 
              which are prohibited.
              But this condition is from the fact 
              that the will does not wish to preserve 
              justice or obedience 
              but rather wishes to go against the laws of God. 
              Likewise it is in this way 
              that he will to damn someone 
              from the fact that 
              this person posses a final impenitence. 
              And that he does not will this absolutely 
              is clear from 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q38-Rd1e1136">
                <title ref="#Ezekiel">Ezekiel</title> 18

                <bibl>Ezekiel 18:32</bibl>
              </cit>, 
              etc.
              In the third mode,
              it is understood to be on account of 
              the negation of the required condition, 
              just as when I wish that you walk
              if it were healthy,
              and because I know the condition 
              I do not state it,
              therefore I do not wish this absolutely, 
              and thus in this sense 
              God wishes the good things
              which he commands and advises, 
              even though they do not occur.
              Likewise 
              in this way he wishes 
              for all people to be saved, 
              if the human will were to wish for this 
              and they were not rebelling against the divine will.
              Therefore to the form of the argument, 
              it is able to be said 
              that such a condition is able to be 
              present or past. 
              And when it is argued that, 
              God knows something present, etc., 
              it is said that, 
              though it is certain to God 
              absolutely and determinately that this is, 
              namely that the prohibited act is, 
              nevertheless he does not will 
              the prohibited act absolutely. 
              And likewise because
              according to those holding the opposite 
              God knows absolutely that something evil is and will be, 
              nevertheless he does not wish this absolutely and directly, 
              but rather just as a doctor wishes for there to be a harmful drug in medicine 
              or to make an incision in the one who is sick. 
              To the disproof of the third member, 
              it is said that
              reason alone proves that God 
              does not naturally wish the condition in the first mode.

                </ref>
              </cit>,
              it is said that 
              sometimes 
              he does not will that a condition will be 
              because 
              he does not will that this person sins, 
              nevertheless 
              if he sins,
              then he does will to co-act with this act
              with his general influence.
              Likewise 
              sometimes God wills 
              a condition of this type, 
              not absolutely 
              but secundum quid 
              because he does so 
              with a mixture of the involuntary or displeasure. 
              In this way God wills 
              that his will causes a prohibited act, 
              not absolutely and simply, 
              but with a mixture of the 
              volition for the previously prohibited act 
              and the volition 
              for the one who is displeasing and being detestable <!-- transl check needed -->
              Therefore, 
              when it is said, 
              if God does not will this condition, 
              therefore he wills some condition in vain, 
              the consequences id denied 
              because, 
              though this is condition is put by another, 
              nevertheless it is irrational and evil. 
              And when it is said, 
              further if he wishes this, etc.,
              it follows that he is willing a condition under another condition,
              the consequence is denied.
              Nevertheless 
              it does not follows 
              that he is wishing this absolutely, 
              but only secundum quid 
              with a mixture of involuntariness, 
              as has been said.
              
              
              
              
              
              Ideo cum dicitur, si Deus non vult huius conditionem, 
              ergo frustra vult aliquid sub illa conditione, 
              negatur consequentia quia licet 
              illa conditio ponatur ab alio, 
              tamen irrationabilis est et mala.
