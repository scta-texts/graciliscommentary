              That not because 
              anything dependent on God is infinitely perfect, 
              therefore no such thing is able to become more perfect 
              either in being <!-- entitative --> or essentially.
              The consequence is clear, 
              and the antecedent is proved 
              because any individual thing of a superior species 
              infinitely exceeds the perfection of the individual of an inferior species 
              because the former exceeds 
              through the entire breadth of species producible between itself and the other species. 
              But these producible thing are infinite, 
              therefore anything exceeding in this way 
              is infinitely perfect.

              In the second place, 
              if something created were able to be made better in being <!-- entitatively -->
              it follows that this would be a being 
              closer to the highest independent being
              than the previous.
              The consequent is false 
              because any dependent thing 
              is infinitely distant from God in terms of perfection, 
              therefore not created this closer to him than any other.
              The consequence is clear 
              because nearness to the highest being 
              seems to be a part of the perfection of things.

              In the third place, 
              if God perfected man essentially, 
              then either man would remain 
              in the human species or not.
              Not the first 
              because any specific perfection 
              consists in something indivisible, 
              just as the species of any number.
              But if the second option is granted 
              then it follows that 
              man is not improved 
              in terms of perfection or essentially. 
              The consequences is clear 
              because from the fact 
              that he ceased to be in the human species,
              he ceased to be a man, 
              therefore the question is false.

              since to any finite perfect 
              God is able to add some grade of perfection.
              But every thing dependent on God is of a finite perfection, 
              therefore the question is true.

              First conclusion: 
              any species externally producible, 
              just as it is of a limited perfection, 
              so no such species exceeds 
              another intrinsecally, quidditatively, or infinitely.
              
              The first part is proved 
              because, 
              it this were the case, 
              then it would follow that 
              infinity would contain 
              denominations of perfection absolutely.
              The consequent is false 
              because then it would be God.
              And the consequence is clear 
              because, 
              if the opposite of the consequent were granted, 
              it would follow that it is not 
              intrinsically perfect absolutely and infinitely, 
              which is the opposite of the antecedent.
              This is confirmed becase, 
              just one intensively infinite thing 
              does not exceed another intensively infinite thing, 
              so perfectionally infinite thing 
              does not exceed another perfectionally infinite thing.
              The second part is proved 
              because the quiddity of any species is finite, 
              therefore it only exceeds another finitely.
              The consequences is clear 
              since what is exceeded is not greater than what is exceeding.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because the quiddity of a thing 
              is not greater 
              than the intrinsic perfection of it is.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e3400">
              First corollary: 
              though no species exceeds another absolutely infinitely, 
              nevertheless the highest thing 
              necessarily equally immeasurably exceeds anything created. 
              This is clear because 
              whatever it exceeds it exceeds completely <!-- translation check --> 
              since it is perfection, super simple, and indivisible, 
              therefore.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e3424">
              Second corollary: 
              though no two species are 
              equally perfect absolutely, 
              nevertheless 
              the highest thing necessarily 
              equally immeasurably exceeds any created species.
              Or said another way, 
              though is more perfect than a donkey, 
              nevertheless they are equally exceeded by God.
              The first is clear. <!-- translation check -->
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e3441">
              Third corollary: 
              if some species were to contain 
              infinite
              <pb ed="#L" n="107-v"/>
              individuals, 
              it would not be on account of this that 
              that it is more perfect then that it is now. 
              Or the third corollary can be said thus, 
              that any species of latitude <!-- translation check --> 
              beyond what is producible 
              is comparable to another in any mode. <!-- translation check -->
              This is clear because any finite thing is 
              comparable to another finite thing in some mode.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e344X">
              Another corollary: 
              it is both repugnant that two species are similarly equal in imperfection 
              and it is repugnant that these be compared in some specific perfection.
              This is clear because 
              whatever things are compared 
              it is necessary that they be compared in some
              similar denomination of perfection which is common to each  
              and predicable of each thing being compared 
              because blackness is not able to be compared to whiteness in terms of blackness, 
              but rather in terms of color 
              according to which one of them 
              is a more intense color, 
              or a weaker, or a more perfect color 
              than the other.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e3499">
              Second conclusion: 
              though de facto some two species are immediate, 
              nevertheless between any two species 
              are infinite producible species.
              This is clear because between the human and angelic species 
              there is de facto nothing in between. 
              The second part is proved 
              since the excess of one species over another 
              is divisible,
              and consequently 
              divisible according to an imaginable continuous quantity,
              and thus according to the points of this quantity 
              there are more perfect producibile things 
              and less perfect things, 
              and since the points of this quantity are infinite, 
              the proposed follows. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because what is indivisible is not made better or more perfect

              First corollary:

              than there are producible speces 
              between man and the angels. 
              This is clear 
              because there are infinite producible in both cases.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e3533">
              The second corollary: 
              just as the specific perfection or the perfection of a created entity 
              does not apply precisely to the replication of the unity of the divine, 
              so perfections of the species are not universally disposed or formed 
              like the species of numbers.
              The first is clear 
              because then it would follow that an angel would have 
              greater perfection than understanding and willing. <!-- doesn't make a lot of sense to me; dbcheck transl -->
              The consequent is false 
              because there is nothing greater revealed in scripture.
              And the consequence is clear,
              the reason is because <!-- 'the reason is because' as transl for unclear "causa" -->
              man has these perfections
              because man is able to understand and to will.
              The second part is proved 
              because between the binary and tertiary 
              there is no producible in between species, 
              as there is between specific perfections.

              so no superior species contains an inferior species formally. 
              This is clear because such a perfection is punctual <!-- punctual meaning "discrete" rather than "continuous" ?? -->
              and just as when a unity is added or removed the species varies in number,

              because, 
              if this were true, 
              then it would follow that man would formally a donkey.

              Third conclusion: 
              though no created thing remaining below the limits of its own species

              nevertheless

              God is able to make it better 
              to produce something in it perfectionally better.
              The first part is proved 
              because through the addition of any essential grade 
              the specific perfection is changed. 
              The antecedent is clear

              Second corollary: 
              though it would not be the case that two species would be equally perfect essentially, 
              nevertheless it is repugnant that two species are accidentally equal. 
              The first part is clear 
              because these two species are not more different 
              than two individuals of the same species

              Against the first conclusion, 
              it is argued 
              that any grade of perfection absolutely below the immeasured 
              is communicable to a creature 
              through participation, 
              therefore some producible species 
              is or is able to be of an infinite perfeciton.
              The consequence holds,
              and the antecedent is proved 
              because no great is repugnant to a creature, 
              nor is one repugnant to another,
              since all concur at the same time
              in the divine essence,

              nor is there repugnance on the part of communication

              therefore something external 
              adequate to his power 
              is able to correspond to him.

              to exceed a creature in terms of perfection. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because less excess 
              does not introduce distance or make better.

              that the approach or drawing near of the creature to the highest 
              happens in two ways. 
              One is the extrinsic approach of that perfect 
              and this is measured according to the distance

              The other is the intrinsic distance of the creature 
              and this is between the specific perfection 
              and the zero-degree of perfection absolutely

              contains eminently the entire latitude of perfection of its inferior,

              extrinsic to the creature.

              an approach to the highest in this mode 
              is an acquisition of divine participation
              and the better this participation, 
              the more perfect the creature is. 
              And this is not therefore 
              because the more similar the creature is to God,
              the more it participates in divine goodness, 
              but rather the reverse
              because the more greatly it participates in divine goodness, 
              therefore the more similar it is to God

              the more creature participates,
              the more it imitates God,

              is the same as its departure from the zero-degree, 
              though the specific perfect 
              is properly measured through the approach to the highest degree
              rather than through its departure from the zero-degree 
              because as an approach 
              it is something positive

            that God is able to do things different than what he does

            he would be able to do better.

            or did not wish to sin,

            Second conclusion: 
            that God

            some would be able to made in a better way

          <p xml:id="pgb1q36-d1e4535">
            Third conclusion: 
            that God is able to do 
            whatever he was at one time able to do 
            and he always wishes 
            whatever he at one time wished, 
            that is he has the power and will 
            which he at one time had. 
            Whence he is able to be incarnated 
            by the same power that he was incarnated 
            just as he is the same knowledge 
            by which he knew that would be resurrected 
            and knows that he was resurrected. 
            Nevertheless he is not always able to make 
            everything that he was at sometime able to do 
            nor does he always wish to be or to become 
            but was or was made, 
            and thus about his knowledge
