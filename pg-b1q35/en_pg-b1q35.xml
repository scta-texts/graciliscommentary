              That not because nothing is able to be done by God, therefore.
              The consequence is valid 
              because the conclusion supposes the opposite. 
              The antecedent is proved because, 
              if this were so, 
              then it follows 
              that every creature is possible

              just as therefore a house is able to be made by man 
              because man is an artifact knowing how and able to make a house.
              An the consequence is clear for a similar reason 
              because therefore an impossible <c>a</c> is not able to made by God 
              because such a impossible thing is not able to be made possible

              In the second place,

              it would follow that,
              even that which God did not preordain 
              that he would do,
              he would be able to do.
              The consequence is clear from a similar reason, 
              but the consequent is false. 
              The proof is because 
              then God would be able to produce something infinite, 
              since there does not seem to a be a greater reason 
              for one non-preordained thing 
              than for another to be to be in the future.

              In the third place, 
              it is inconvenient 
              not to be done by a prudent man 
              because he preordained and fore-said that he would do it
              and because if were to act justly and decently, 
              then he would do it, 
              therefore it would be inconvenient 
              for God not to do what he preordained that he would do, 
              and consequently this is impossible. 
              The last consequence is clear 
              through <name ref="#Anselm">Anselm</name>
              because the smallest inconvenience is impossible in God.

              In opposition is the

              but he had pre-ordained

              and yet he was freely able 
              to rescue it and keep it from pain and death,

              he is able not to do.
              <!-- break? -->
              This is confirmed 
              because whatever God preordained 
              that he would do, 
              he preordained this

              therefore the question is true.

              First conclusion: 
              though God therefore 
              is not able to produce impossible <c>a</c> into existince 
              because it is impossible for <c>a</c> to be produced into existnce, 
              nevertheless therefore producible <c>b</c> 
              is able to be 
              because God is able to produce <c>b</c> into existnce.
              The first part is proved because, 
              if not, 
              then it follows that the converse is true, 
              therefore <c>a</c> is not able to be 
              because God is not able to produce <c>a</c>. 
              But this is false 
              because this would imply an insufficiency 
              indeed an insufficient of the power of God, 
              therefore.
              The last consequence is clear 
              because through this it is indicated 
              that the first cause and ratio of this impossibility 
              would be the negation of power in God
              and a defect with respect to the power required for producing this. 
              Example: if therefore the sun 
              is not able to illuminate beyond the heavens 
              or below the closed house 
              because this place is not an illuminable place 
              or because there is a obstacle through an opaque body, 
              and yet there is no defect of power attributed to the sun. 
              This is confirmed because, 
              if therefore vision is not able to see sound 
              because sound is not visible 
              and therefore not conversely for a similar reason, 
              therefore God is not able, etc. <supplied>to produce and impossible <c>a</c></supplied>.
              The second part of the conclusion is proved 
              because it says, 
              <c>b</c> is, 
              therefore it is because God gave being to it; 
              therefore this is true as long <c>b</c> is able to exist; 
              therefore it is able to exist 
              because God is able to give being to it; 
              therefore the whole conclusion is true. 
              This is confirmed through

              First corollary: 
              though every makeable things is able 
              to be produced effectively by God acting alone, 
              nevertheless God is not able by himself to produce effectively
              every makable thing according to its every condition and denomination. 
              The first part was clear in the preceding conclusion. 
              The second part is proved 
              because he is not able to produce a meritorious act with a condition of respect or relation 
              which implies a contradiction, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because to be meritorious is a condition of an act 
              as related to some relatable cause 
              while acting in conformity to a divine rule
              Again, 
              a meritorious act indicates a relation to something 
              freely accepting such an act for a certain reward, <!-- translation check -->
              therefore as such it is not 
              able to be produced by God acting alone.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q35-d1e3498">
              Second corollary: 
              that therefore God is not able 
              to make contradictories true at the same time
              because these things are from their own natures 
              formally repugnant. 
              This is clear because it would be useless 
              to assign an extrinsic cause 
              for their repugnance and impossibility 
              since they are impossible and repugnant 
              from their own quiddities.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q35-d1e3510">
              Third corollary: 
              though the impossibility of producing 
              impossible <c>a</c> 
              comes from the nature of the producible or impossible thing, 
              nevertheless 
              the impossibility of sinning 
              does not come from the nature of sin 
              but from the sinless nature of God.
              The first part is clear 
              through things that have been said
              The second part is proved 
              because the occurrence of sin is made possible by the creature, 
              therefore its impossibility should not be assigned to the nature of sin
              by which it is impossible that God sins.
              but rather he is not able to sin 
              because he is the highest perfection and necessary goodness
              without any wickedness. 
              From which it would be able to be inferred that, 
              though <c>a</c> is possible 
              therefore it is able to exist 
              because God is omnipotent, 
              nevertheless impossible <c>b</c> 
              is not therefore able to exist 
              because God is not omnipotent. <!-- dbcheck; seem like intentional equivocation with the meaning of "omnipotence" -->
              Again, 
              it follows that it is more convenient to say 
              therefore man is not able to be an ass 
              because God does not wish that he is so
              than to say
              God is not able to make it so. 
              This is clear because 
              the second statement 
              <pb ed="#L" n="104-v"/>
              indicates an imperfection in God

              Second conclusion: 
              though God through his immeasurable power 
              is able to produce something infinitely perfect
              in the genus of an accident, 
              nevertheless he is not able 
              to produce or make something of infinite perfection absolutely 
              in the genus of substance.
              The first part is proved 
              because God is able to produce a whiteness 
              which would be an infinitely perfect whiteness, 
              and nevertheless would not be an infinitely perfect accident <!-- translation check; seems to contradict what he said above -->
              nor an infinitely perfect being absolutely, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved because this does not

              Third conclusion: 
              just as God is able to never have wished 
              that which he willed from eternity, 
              so God is able to never produce
              that which he ordained that he would do. 
              The first part is clear through what has been said in 
              other questions. 
              This is confirmed because he wills freely and contingently, 
              therefore he is able not to will, 
              to the fact that 
              God is able not to will 
              it follows that he is able to never have willed, 
              therefore.
              The second part of the conclusion 
              is proved from the first part 
              because his will is effectively his doing, 
              therefore just as he is able not to will 
              that which he wills, 
              so he is able to never produce 
              that which he preordained
              that he would do.
              It is confirmed,
              the created will 
              freely and contingently 
              produced his act, 
              therefore the divine will also when it acts externally. <!-- translation check -->
              The consequence is clear 
              since the ratio of freedom and contingency of a creature 
              is rooted and founded in the divine liberty, 
              and the antecedent we experience 
              because we perceive that we are able to will what we will or 
              what we do not will 
              or conversely 
              able to not will what we will 
              or what we do not will.

              The first corollary: 
              to the fact that God necessarily wills 
              that the antichrist will be, 
              it follows that 
              all things occur, 
              not contingently, but from necessity. <!-- translation check; is this correct? all things happen necessarily??? -->
              This is clear 
              because according to the 
              <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>
              since his will is omnipotent, 
              it follows that if he wishes <c>a</c>, 
              then <c>a</c> will necessarily be.
              But the same argument applies regarding any future,
              therefore etc.
              This is confirmed because, 
              if future <c>a</c> occurs contingently, 
              having supposed that God wishes that this will be necessarily,
              this will seem to be therefore 
              because second causes would freely and contingently produce 
              <c>a</c> into being, 
              but this is false 
              because the same necessity and in the same mode 
              by which God wishes this future will be
              he wills these causes influence or concur 
              for the production of this with the same necessity. 
              Again, 
              if these causes produced freely, 
              it follows also that God produces and wishes freely
              <pb ed="#L" n="105-r"/> 
              The consequence is clear 
              from what has been said 
              since freedom of the second cause depends 
              on the first liberty and the divine will.

              this varies in no way.
              This is clear because

              To the fourth, 
              the consequences is denied
              because it is necessitated from itself

            First conclusion: 
            that God is able to make many things 
            which he makes 
            and to will other things 
            which he wishes de facto. <!-- translation check on de facto -->

            Second conclusion: 
            that what God makes 
            it is fitting for him to make, 
            and if he were to make other things, 
            it would be fitting for him to make them, 
            and nevertheless his will 
            is not able to be different nor new nor changeable in some way. 
            For though he is able to will that he never willed this, 
            nevertheless he is not able to will a new will; 
            but his will is eternal 
            which he shows in many arguments and authorities.
