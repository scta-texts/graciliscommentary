            treated how things are in the divine science, 
            now he shows how God is in the essence of every creature. 
            And this is divided in three 
            because in the first place regarding the being of God in things 
            he lists some modes and approves of the true modes, 
            in the second place he disproves false modes, 
            in third place he confirms manifest what he says.

            he does two things

            The following question is asked,
            whether the divine or necessary principle 
            in every being is a necessary being; <!-- translation check needed --> 
            whether just as God is the true and infallible idea of everything, 
            so also every thing is locus of the capacity of God himself, though changeable?

              That not because 
              it would follow 
              that God would not be able in some situations <!-- trans check "some situations for "aliquo passo situaliter" --> 
              to act at a distance.
              The consequent is false 
              because then an agent acts more quickly 
              on something near at hand 
              than something further removed.
              With the supposed disposition 
              the consequence is clear, 
              if God is everywhere, 
              it follows no thing is locally at a distance from God. 
              This is confirmed 
              because it is the case that God is everywhere
              according to power and not according to essence,
              therefore. <!-- paragraph needs trans review -->

              In the second place, 
              God is able to acquire a certain place, 
              therefore God is not fixed in every place.
              The consequence holds, 
              and the antecedent is clear 
              both because God is able to be in a place 
              or in a creature 
              in which he is not, 
              and also because it is possible 
              that some being is not the locus of God
              because no created being is a necessary being.

              In the third place, 
              God is not present everywhere, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              in the first place 
              God is able to begin to be anywhere, 
              for having supposed that were to destroy every created place 
              and then afterward were to recreate it, 
              then in this case he would begin to be everywhere. 
              Secondly 
              because is not an inspiration or an empty imagined thing. 
              Thirdly because the God-man is not everywhere, 
              therefore God is not everywhere.
              The consequence holds because every God<supplied>-man</supplied> is man,  
              and the antecedent is proved because God is not everywhere man, 
              otherwise some body would de facto be in an infinity of places.

              The consequence is clear.

              then it is sufficiently inferred

              This is proved because

              With respect to the corollary,

              so that God moves from place to place, 
              from time to time,

              therefore he is there through his power, 
              but he is not in that same place through his essence. 
              Therefore it is the case

              therefore the divine power is able 
              to produce something distant from itself. 
              The consequence holds

              Against the second conclusion and corollaries, 
              God is able to be in some way 
              in a place he previously was not, 
              and he is able also not to be 
              where he previously was, 
              therefor God is moveable and changeable. 
              The consequence is clear,

              because, 
              if <c>b</c> should be destroyed,

              if a new place should be created, 
              then God will be newly present in that place.
              This is confirmed 
              because, 
              if God now destroyed the highest heaven, 
              God would not be where the highest heaven now is,

              God would be in that same place,

              Against this, 
              it is argued 
              because to move locally is 
              to be now in some place 
              and earlier be in one place or another. 
              But this body 
              since it was previously nothing,

              except through body newly created there, 
              it follows that the created body 
              is naturally there before God. 
              The consequent is false 
              because it follows 
              that the body would be able to be created there 
              without God being there 
              because what is naturally prior 
              is able to be without that which is posterior.
              Again
              God is naturally in a place prior to acting there.

              Against the first part of the third conclusion and its corollaries,

              if God is not in empty space outside of heaven 
              and is able to be there without the positioning of a new body, 
              it follows that God is changeable and moveable locally. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear because 
              this kind of transition from not being there to being there 
              is not able to be without change in God or in something else. 
              But the fact tat God is there without a new position etc. 
              is proved because in such an imaginary space 
              God is ale to place an angel with a created body 
              and then is able to annihilate this body 
              while conserving the angel, 
              just as if God were to annihilate 
              the air existing in this house

              because <c>a</c> is true real being and <c>b</c> is not.

              </app>, 
              I say that <c>b</c> is not distant from <c>a</c> 
              because between being and non-being 
              there is no distance.
              <!-- para break ? -->
              In the third place, 
              I say that God would not be ale 
              to move the world from the site 
              in which it is 
              to an imaginary site. 
              The reason is 
              because it is impossible 
              for motion to become acquisitive of place 
              in a vacuum or to move to a terminus 
              that is not a being.

                <title>Sent.</title>,

              </bibl>
            </cit>. 
            The first conclusion of distinction 37: 
            that God always existing unchangeably in himself 
            is in every nature or essence 
            presently, potentially, and essentially 
            without definition 
            and without circumscription in every place, 
            and without change in every time,
            and resides in holy spirits and in animals through grace, 
            but in the man christ he is most excellently 
            because in him the fullness of the deity dwells corporally.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4263">
            Second conclusion: 
            that where God dwells 
            there God is, 
            nevertheless 
            not everywhere is the place that he dwells, 
            for just as the whole soul of Adam 
            is in the same moment in every part of his body 
            and it is not less present in lesser members 
            and nevertheless in some parts it acts more intensely 
            and in other parts less intensely, 
            so God is everywhere but in the saints especially 
            and in those in whom he dwells 
            he is said to exist in a special way 
            as in a temple, 
            but there are the wicked also 
            and if God, 
            who is never absent,
            is there where they are, 
            nevertheless they are not with him, 
            therefore it is said 
            our father who is in heaven, 
            (that is in the saints in whom he is in a special way 
            namely through grace) 
            but is not everywhere.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4292">
            Third conclusion: 
            that God before things were 
            was in himself. 
            Whence God is in himself 
            and in things, 
            for the said are not called the house of God, 
            such that when these are removed God would fall away
            but it is said that God dwells in the saints, 
            such that, 
            if he were to withdraw 
            they would fall away and be deficient.
          </p> 
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4305">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that God is a dweller of some not knowing God, 
            such as children reborn through baptism, 
            and dweller of some knowing God, 
            such as the blessed who are loving God, 
            but of some knowing he is not a dweller, 
            such as the wicked who know him 
            but do not love him, 
            for they do not belong to the temple of God 
            who knowing God do not in the same way glorify God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4319">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            just as the rays of the sun are not contaminated by dirt, 
            so the divine essence existing every where 
            is not stained by any thing sordid.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q29-d1e4325">
            Sixth conclusion
            that every body is a locale 
            and <unclear>divisive</unclear> in place 
            and according to time. 
            But the created spirit is a local, 
            but not <unclear>divisive</unclear>, 
            but determinative, 
            for so it is here 
            because it is not found elswhere 
            and its moved according to place
            and according to time 
            since it undergoes
            changes of joy, pay, knowledge, and oblivion. 
            But is God is not a locale 
            and uncircumscribable 
            existing everywhere in totality 
            because he is moved 
            neither according to time nor place, 
            but is entirely unmovable.
