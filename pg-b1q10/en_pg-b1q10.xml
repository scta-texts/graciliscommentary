            This is the ninth distinction of this first book 
            in which after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined about divine generation, 
            now he determines about the coeternal generation of the Father and the Son. 
            And he divides this into two parts 
            because he first shows their coeternity 
            wither respect to the intrinsic mode of being, 
            in the second place with respect to the mode of speaking or signifying. 
            The second begins at

            second he considers their equal duration, 
            third he introduces against this the objection of the heretics, 
            fourth he defeats the presumption of the opposition.

                That not because the Word is the measure of a creature, 
                therefore the Word is not coeternal with the Father.
                The antecedent is clear and the consequence is proved 
                because equal and proportionate in a measured way to what it measures.

                In the second place 
                the divine Word is immense, 
                therefore it is not measured by eternity 
                because it seems to be a contradiction for the immense to be measured.
                The antecedent is a catholic truth. 
                This is confirmed because the Word is above and beyond eternity, 
                therefore it is not measured by eternity.
                Elsewhere it is proved in <ref><title ref="#ex">Exodus</title> chapter 3:</ref>

                First conclusion
              </head>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e200">
                The first conclusion: 
                though eternally or the duration of eternity 
                in abstract to world outside itself is not a communicable perfection, 
                nevertheless this is an eternal and formal measure of whatever is produced.
                The first part is because it would follow that a creature would be able to be coeternal with God 
                or that any creature would be produced before some time, 
                but each of these options is false or impossible, therefore.
                The second part is proved 
                because the properties of measure do not properly suit God with respect to a creature 
                and not only transumptively, therefore.
                The antecedent is show by
                <ref><name ref="#GilesOfRome">Giles</name>, in book two, distinction eight, question three, in part two</ref>
                since the ratio of number fits himself temporally, uniformally, absolutely, and indivisibly.
                Secondly, 
                because ratio of adequation suits the the creature in two ways, 
                namely through conformity and imitation, 
                therefore it follows that God is causally, formally 
                the measure of any produced being.
                The first part of the conclusion is confirmed 
                because invariability, immutability, and simultaneity, 
                therefore not eternity.
                The consequence is clear because these are properties
                of eternity as will be clear later.
                And the antecedent is clear because according to Gregory 
                <cit>
                  <quote  xml:id="pg-b1q10-Qeiqvmh">in that in which a creature is, 
                  it has the vicissitude of changeability</quote>

                </cit>.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e236">
                The first corollary: 
                immensity and eternity of measure 
                do not infer the immensity of the measured nature, 
                against 
                <ref>
                  <name ref="#Ripa">John of Marchia</name>, 
                  in the first question of his  
                  <title ref="#SentencesRipa">Sentences</title>, 
                  in his determination in the response of the first argument
                  against the second conclusion
                </ref>. 
                This is clear because 
                the immense God is the formal measure of the creature, 
                and nevertheless the creature is not immense,
                and as a consequence is not proportionally adequate to him, 
                as he says there.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e257">
                The second corollary: 
                the ratio of formal eternity 
                is not a denomination of perfection absolutely.
                This is clear because any such perfection is 
                communicable outside itself to a creature concretely,
                but eternity is not communicable to a creature, therefore.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e265">
                From the first corollary 
                and conclusion it follows that 
                any material and divisible nature is measured 
                by an immaterial and indivisible measure 
                in some mode and not adequately.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e277">
                The third corollary: 
                though eternity as such is not a perfection as if absolutely denotively, 
                nevertheless it is a mode of perfection in identity, really, and entitatively.
                The first part is clear through the 
                <cit>
                  <ref target="http://scta.info/resource/pgb1q10-d1e257">second corollary</ref>

                The second is proved because eternity is essentially the eternal God.

                The first corollary: 
                the measure of any divine operation or causality 
                is an every present and indivisible instant of eternity.
                This is clear because God is his own 
                operation taken nominally and actively, therefore. 
                This is confirmed because both God and creature are measured by eternity, 
                and as a consequence by this instant 
                because they are precisely the same thing.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e346">
                The second corollary: 
                a plurality of gods is as repugnant to divinity as 
                multiplicity of signs is repugnant to eternity.
                therefore any measure of it is totally adequate to it. 
                But any sign or instant of eternity is a proper measure of it, 
                therefore any such thing is simple and not multiple. 
                And I understand through <mentioned>equal measure with God</mentioned> lasting supersimple permanence 
                and being independent and without a beginning.

              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e375">
                Third corollary: 
                just as eternity is a measure intrinsecly exlcuding a plurality of signs, 
                so an instant of eternity is including contentively every durative succession. 
                The first part is opposed to <ref><name ref="#Scotus">Scotum</name> in many places</ref>
                which is proved thus 
                because otherwise the entire Trinity will be more multiple than its signification, <!-- need translation help --> 
                which is false and against the

                Again the sign would be simpler than its eternity, which is false.

                <name ref="#HugolinoOfOrvieto">Hugolino</name>
                which is proved because the instant of eternity is 
                adequately this instant of eternity, 
                therefore any instant of eternity 
                is a precontentive instant of eternity contentively including this and 
                inclusively containing this. 
                But eternity precontains and includes every 
                successive durative pause both real and imaginative, 
                therefore.

                Third conclusion: 
                the generation of the eternal word or 
                to generate eternally in an instant of eternity 
                is considered to be measured. 
                This is clear through

                Again this is proved by reason 
                because this generation is 
                invariable, incorruptible, simultaneous without succession,
                but these are properties of eternity, therefore.

                The first corollary: 
                it is not the case that the Word is able to be called for any sign 
                and in that instant this is not produced through generation, 
                which is contrary to

                  <bibl>Scotus, Ordinatio, I, d. 22, q. 2</bibl>
                </cit>.
                This is proved because 
                if in some sign the Father were able to generate 
                the Son and for that instant he would not generate him,
                it follows that generation would not be measured 
                by an instant lacking a beginning.
                The consequent is false through what has been said.
                The consequence is clear 
                because the first sign in which a first person 
                is habitually fecund would precede the generation of the Son, 
                and as a consequence for that instant 
                there will be a preceding negation of the word, 
                which is false.
              </p>
              <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e501">
                The second corollary: 
                for any sign the Father generates an only begotten, 
                while the Son spirates the Holy Spirit with the same sign, 
                contra <name ref="#Scotus">Scotus</name>, 
                where it is proved above, 
                and in the sign 
                the first sign of the origin 
                in which the Father is fecund and the Son not according to him. 
                And let this sign be <c>a</c> 
                and the second sign in which the Son is fecund be <c>b</c>, 
                then in this case <c>a</c> has a separate negation of fecundity 
                of the Son, 
                therefore in <c>a</c> the Son is not fecund, 
                and <c>a</c> is before <c>b</c>, 
                therefore 
                the Son is not fecund prior to the point when he is fecund. 
                The consequence is clear because 
                <c>a</c> is prior, <c>b</c> is posterior, 
                otherwise <c>a</c> would not be first 
                and <c>b</c> second as he says.
                But this consequent is false 
                because then the Son would begin to be fecund and he would not be fecund without beginning 
                against what has been said, 
                therefore the corollary is true.

                The third corollary is the affirmative title of the question which

                This is confirmed

                besides some origin not in any place. <!-- translation help -->
                I do not intend to deny through what has been said in this question

                <pb ed="#L" n="37-v"/>
                an instant of eternity there are three signs of the origin. 
                In the first are all the essentials, namely knowledge, wisdom, goodness, etc.
                In the second the Father generates the Son. 
                In the third he spirates the Holy Spirit and 
                he says consequently that the Father spirates the Holy Spirit 
                from an origin prior to that of the Son,

                The responsive corollary <name ref="#AlphonsusVargas">Alphonsus</name> proves thus, 
                virtually in the Son and to any divine person 
                for any sign of the origin or nature it is repugnatn not to be, 
                therefore also to be posterior, 
                therefore no person is prior to the other. 
                The antecedent is clear because it is necessary in the highest degree. 
                And the consequence is clear because, 
                for if for some some sign one person is prior, then another is posterior. 
                But therefore in that sign 
                the Son has being or not.  
                If yes, then in that instant the Father is not prior to him. 
                If not, then the Son has being after 
                non being and thus is produced from non being to being. 
                The consequence is clear because in the second he has being, 
                indeed it follows that no being is not repugnant to the Son which 
                in opposition to the antecedent.

                but because the Father has from the Father the spirative power.
                But against this it is objected through 
                <ref><name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>, 
                  in book <title>de triplici habitaculo</title></ref>

                that is, because the Son is from the Father by order of nature,

              <bibl><ref target="http://scta.info/resource/pll1d9c1-d1e3477">Lombardus, Sent. I, d. 9, c. 1 [n.1], (I, 103, ll. 6).</ref></bibl>
            </cit>. 
            This distinction contains nine conclusions. 
            First that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one God, 
            nevertheless in nature the Father is not the Son, nor is the Son the Father, 
            nor is the Holy Spirit the Father or the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1239">
            Second conclusion: 
            there is one essence of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit 
            in which there is not another Father, another Son, and another Holy Spirit, 
            though personally there a Father which is other than the Son which is other than the Holy Spirit.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1247">
            Third conclusion: 
            though the Son is born from the Father, 
            nevertheless the Father was not before the Son, 
            but rather all three personas are coeternal and coequal with one another.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1255">
            Fourth conclusion: just as splendor which is born from fire is 
            coeternal with the fire or would be, 
            so is the Son with the fire. 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1261">
            Fifth conclusion: when we say or name the father, 
            we designate the son 
            because no one is a father to himself. 
            But when we name the son, 
            we also acknowledge the son 
            because non one is a son to himself, 
            from which it follows that 
            there is not able to be son without the father 
            nor a father without the son, 
            therefore there is always a father and a son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1272">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that the generation of the Son of God is ineffable 
            because it is not able to be fully exemplified or understood by any mortals, 
            though something about it is able to be understood and expressed.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1280">
            The seventh conclusion: 
            though it is able to be conceded 
            that the Son is always born from the Father, 
            it is more congruent to say that he always has been born.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q10-d1e1286">
            Eight conclusion: 
            that we admit that the only begotten God was born before time 
            and was not born before being nor was in being before it was born. 
            And thus concerning this distinction.
