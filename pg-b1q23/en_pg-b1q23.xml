            This is distinction 26 which continues the preceding, 
            for after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            determined about the names which are able to be said about God extrinsecally, 
            now consequently he determines about the properties 
            which suit God instrinsically. 
            And this is divided into two parts
            because in the first place he treats 
            the properties according to their proper being, 
            in the second place according to their compared being.

              That not 
              because in the divine there is some absolute supposite, 
              therefore there are more supposites 
              than properties. 
              The consequence holds 
              because there are precisely as many relative properties 
              as there are relative things.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because actions belong to supposites, 
              but action formally suits the divine essence, 
              therefore also the suppositable ratio. 
              Again in the second place 
              because understanding only suits supposites, 
              but the essence understands formally, 
              indeed essential understanding, as it seems, 
              precedes notional understanding, therefore. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e3188">
              In the second place, 
              the divine supposites are distinguished from the essence, 
              therefore. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because a distinction in the divine implies a relative opposition
              according to <name ref="#Anselm">Anselm</name>, 
              and consequently he argues for a relative property in each distinct thing, 
              therefore in the divine essence there is a relative property 
              distinct from the properties of the supposites.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because about the essence and persons 
              there are truly called contraries, 
              as for example communicable and non-communicable. 
              In the second place, 
              the antecedent is proved 
              because the Son is something that is not the Father, 
              therefore the Son is something that is not the essence. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because whatever is the essence is the Father. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because the Son is the supposite of the Son
              which is not the Father.
              In the third place, 
              the same antecedent is proved 
              because the essence is absolutely perfect, 
              but no supposite is absolutely perfect, 
              therefore.

              In third place principally, 
              it is argued 
              there are more relative properties than supposites, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because any relative property constitute a supposite.
              In the second place 
              because there are as many real things internally 
              as there are relations. 
              In the third place,

            <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e3260">
              First conclusion: 
              just as any divine supposite 
              <pb ed="#L" n="72-r"/> 
              is simple and necessarily in the highest degree, 
              so no divine supposite is properly constituted in being by a property. 
              The first part is proved 
              because any divine supposite is not less simple 
              that the divine essence, 
              but it is necessary that this being is simple in the highest degree, 
              therefore for the supposite.
              The second part is proved 
              because, 
              if the Father were constituted 
              in being by a property, 
              it follows that the Father in some mode would have a cause or beginning. 
              The consequent is false 
              because the Father is the beginning without a beginning. 
              And the consequence is clear 
              because something constitutive 
              is in some mode a cause and beginning of that 
              which it constitutes.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e3294">
              First corollary: 
              if some divine supposite were constituted in being 
              by its own property, 
              then every supposite would be distinguished by its own property.
              This is clear 
              because everything constituting 
              is distinguished by what it constitutes, 
              since every thing constituting 
              is a beginning and cause of what it constitutes, 
              as is the proof of the conclusion states.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e3303">
              Second corollary: 
              it is as repugnant 
              that the Father is distinguished from his paternity, 
              as it is repugnant to him 
              that he is constituted in being 
              by his paternity.
              This is clear 
              because otherwise the same thing 
              would constitute itself in being, 
              which does not seem to be imaginable. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e3316">
              Third corollary: 
              just it is not the case that in the divine 
              there is some constituted supposite, 
              so it is not the case that in the divine 
              there is some absolute supposite. 
              It is proved 
              because then there would not be a trinity in the divine, 
              but also a quaternity,

            Sixth conclusion: 
            though there are many gifts of God, 
            nevertheless the Holy Spirit 
            by an immutable and eternal property is thus gift, 
            just as the Son by a property is the Son, 
            but by this property is not called gift
            because the Holy Spirit, and each by a name, 
            is called relatively, 
            though this relation does not so appear 
            in the name Holy Spirit, 
            as it does in this name gift.

            Seventh conclusion: 
            that the Trinity is able to be called <mentioned>holy spirit</mentioned> 
            because it is spirit and it is holy, 
            and in this case <mentioned>Holy Spirit</mentioned> is not said relatively
            but according to the essence 
            because properly the Holy Spirit, 
            who is not the Trinity but in the Trinity, 
            is said relatively.

            Eight conclusion: 
            though the Holy Spirit is said relatively 
            to the Father and to the Son, 
            nevertheless the Father is not 
            said to be the Father of the Holy Spirit, 
            though the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father.
            Similarly, 
            The Son is not called the Father of the Holy Spirit, 
            though the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Son,
            nevertheless it is possible to be called 
            the gift of the giver

            Ninth: 
            though the giver and the gift 
            are said relative to one another,

            unless with respect to time,
            even though the gift is from eternity <!-- translation check at "even though" --> 
            because the Holy Spirit is or is able to be called

            The first conclusion of distinction 27: 
            that according to <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name> 
            it is proper to the Father that he generated the Son, 
            but propert to the Son that he is generated by the Father, 
            to the Holy Spirit that it is proceeds from both.
            But according to <name ref="#HilaryOfPoitiers">Hilary</name>
            it is proper to the Father 
            that he is always the Father, 
            and of the Son that he always the Son, 
            and the Holy Spirit that it is always the Holy Spirit 
            or gift. 
            According to others 
            the property of the Father is paternity, 
            of the Son filiation, 
            and of the Holy Spirit procession, 
            and the same properties 
            are signified in the aforementioned words.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4112">
            The second conclusion: 
            that the name of the Father not only notes a relation, 
            but also signifies a hypostasim,
            that is a substance, 
            so also the Son and the Holy Spirit. 
            But the names of relations, 
            namely paternity, filiation, procession 
            or to beget, to be begotten, to proceed 
            signify relations not hypostases.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4127">
            <pb ed="#L" n="74-r"/>
            Third conclusion: 
            that when it is said 
            God is the Father, 
            by the name Father 
            we note the relation and signify the divine hypostasim, 
            but when we posit the names of relations in predicates, 
            we only signify notions, 
            not hypostases, 
            as is the case when we say God generated,
            that is, he has the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4137">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that individual properties  
            property suit the persons at the same time, 
            and through these 
            the persons are determined 
            and differ from one another 
            and do not recede from one another. <!-- need translation help with "recede" -->

          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4148">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            names are different things 
            which signify persons 
            and denote the properties of them,
            namely begetter, begotten, 
            word, image, 
            whence word is said relatively 
            to that of which it is an image.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4167">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that the Son by the same property or notion 
            is called word and image 
            because the Son <!-- something missing here -->
            but in that in which word <supplied>is said</supplied> 
            wisdom or the essence is said 
            because wisdom or essence 
            are both said relatively 
            just as the word.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4181">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            that though God according to substance 
            is called light, wisdom, and things of this type 
            and never relatively, 
            nevertheless sometimes it is said 
            for related things, 
            that is for persons, 
            but it is not understood relatively, 
            as when it is said 
            <quote xml:id="pg-b1q23-Qd1e1248">God from God, light from light</quote>, 
            one instance stands for the Father 
            and the other for the Son.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4191">
            Eight conclusion: 
            that the <mentioned>word from word</mentioned> 
            is not able to be said 
            because both words are not at the same time 
            because Father is not the word, 
            nor <mentioned>image from image</mentioned> nor 
            <mentioned>son from son</mentioned> 
            because image and son they are not at the same time, 
            but only the son, image, or word is.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q23-d1e4210">
            Ninth conclusion: 
            that sometimes the names of the substances 
            signify persons, 
            as when it is said 
            <mentioned>God generated God</mentioned>. 
            Sometimes they signify the entire Trinity, 
            as is clear 
            when it is said 
            <quote xml:id="pg-b1q23-Qd1e1273">no one is good except God alone</quote>.
