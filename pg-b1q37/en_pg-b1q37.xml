            in the first place

            description of the divine will,
            then in the second place 
            he adds many definitions of the divine will.

              That not because, 
              if through the strength of the divine will 
              all things <supplied>etc</supplied>, 
              then however much resistance 
              a moveable thing would be increased 
              and created potency would be diminished;
              motion on account of this would never be diminished. <!--transcheck; seems correct, but argument is confusing -->
              The consequent is false 
              as is known from experience.
              And the consequences is clear 
              because the total moving potency 
              in moving and causing
              infinitely exceeds the total resistance.
              This is confirmed 
              because then 
              for the doubling of a created mover
              there would never be a doubling 
              of the speed or of the moveable thing.
              The consequent is against the rules of the

                  <name ref="#Aristotle">Philosopher</name>,

              and is against experience.
              And the consequence is clear 
              because the total proportion or excess of the mover 
              to the resistence of the moveable thing 
              is not able to be doubled, 
              indeed the total moving potency 
              infinitely exceeds 
              the resistive potency of the moveable thing.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q37-d1e3325">
              In the second place, 
              if the divine willing 
              sufficiently regulated everytying, 
              it would follow 
              that every active regulation of someone else 
              would be superfluous.
              The consequent is false 
              because, 
              when God 
              regulates and orders 
              every cause regulating something, 
              it follows that God would do something in vain. 
              But the consequence is clear 
              since the divine willing 
              by itself would be able to regulate equally well.
              This is confirmed because 
              with respect to two things drawing a ship
              if one draws and moves more strongly into infinity 
              than the other, 
              it follows that the second contributes nothing to the motion.
              This is clear 
              because 
              when this second force is
              ruled out and removed 
              there will be no change 
              regarding the motion of the other;
              the ship will be moved 
              with the same speed as before.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q37-d1e3352">
              In the third place, 
              it would be better that bad things do not exist 
              than for them to exist in the universe, 
              therefore the divine will 
              does not regulate for the beauty<!-- decorem--> of the universe.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q37-Qd1e217">

              Again, 
              evil does not perfect nature 
              damages and weakens and takes away from the good.
              The consequence is clear 
              because a good organizer and regulator 
              always ought to regulate for and do what is better, 
              therefore.

              but only those which are through an essence
              This is confirmed by reason 
              because in the essential order of effective causes
              the posterior acts because of the causality of the first cause.
              But God is the first cause in the essential order of effective causes 
              according to theologians and philosophers, 
              therefore any second cause depends on and presupposes
              the causality of God 
              in its being and its action.

              the doubling of the moved or the real action.
              This is clear 
              because the divine power <!-- virtus --> 
              is not able to be doubled,

              The first is clear 
              because fire is produced 
              by natural causes alone

              nevertheless no created effect is

              The first part is clear

              Against the first conclusion, 
              it is argued in the first place 
              because 
              it would follows that God 
              would influence and act 
              for the conservation of <c>b</c> 
              at the same time that 
              he would be doing the same for it destruction.
              The consequent is false
              because then nothing would be able to be corrupted 
              since the resistive power would be as great as the destructive power.
              But action does not come forth 
              from a proportion of equality.
              The consequences is clear 
              because, 
              just as a creature 
              is not able to act unless God is co-acting, 
              so a creature is not able to resist 
              unless God is co-resisting,
              and thus it further follows 
              God would be resisting himself.

              In the second place, 
              it follows that 
              no second cause will move in time 
              but only in an instant.
              The consequent is counter to experience.
              And the consequence is clear 
              because there will be no 
              proportion of resistance 
              to the total moving cause, 
              indeed one of two moving causes 
              exceeds the resistance of a movable thing 
              ad infinitum.

              therefore it is also a sufficient productive cause some effect. 
              The consequence is clear from the terms. 
              And the antecedent is proved 
              because the resistance of moveable <c>b</c> is finite, 
              therefore it is able to be exceeded and overcome by a finite power.
              But moving power exceeding the total resistance 
              of some moveable thing suffices for 
              moving something moveable 
              without the help of another mover 
              which is clear from the fact that 
              since it exceeds the resistance 
              it follows that 
              the power moving is greater

              In the fourth place, 
              let it be put that 
              a second cause ceases to move something moveable, 
              that it was previously moving with the help of God, 
              and that God uniformally continues his causality 
              and motion with respect to moved <c>b</c>,
              then it is asked 
              whether moved <c>b</c> will remain in motion or not.

              then the degree of causality and influence 
              by God was previously causing 
              was the total cause, 
              and the second cause was contributing nothing.
              This is clear 
              because 
              the effect is posited through this causality 
              by which 
              this effect is posited 
              while every other cause 
              is uniformly and consistently is 
              excluded. <!-- translation check; excluded for circumscripta -->
              If the second is given,
              then either 
              nothing of this moved <c>b</c> would be posited, 
              and thus it follows that God would move and nothing would be moved,
              or some part of this moved <c>b</c> would be posited, 
              and then it follows that 
              the second cause has a certain share 
              in the effect 
              and God has another share, 
              which is false.

              and does not have an act of non-volition,

            First conclusion: 
            that the divine will is 
            the divine essence, 
            just as his essence is his knowledge. 
            Whence the will in God 
            does not indicate something effected or moved, 
            as it does in us, 
            but such things are not able 
            to be in God, 
            as has been said.

            Second conclusion: 
            <quote xml:id="pg-b1q37-Qd1e1633">though in God willing and being are the same, 
            nevertheless

            Third conclusion:

            Therefore
            neither should its cause be sought

          <p xml:id="pgb1q37-d1e4830">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that the will of God is not unless it is one, 
            and sometimes it is named please or a disposition, 
            and it is not possible something that something occurs in opposition to this. 
            But sometimes the signs of the divine will 
            are called the will of God, 
            just as the signs of anger 
            are called anger 
            and the signs of love 
            are called love
            and this is a changing expression. <!-- change for "tropica"; not sure what "tropica" means -->
            But signs of the divine will are 
            to command, to permit, to permit 
            to counsel, to operate, 
            or perception, prohibition, permission 
            counsel, and operation.
            Whence what God commands
            is able to be called his will, 
            and in the same way about the other signs.
            And it is possible for something to occur against these kinds of signs 
            because God commands many and a variety of things which do not occur, 
            just as when he commands <name ref="#Abraham">Abraham</name>
            to sacrifice his son,
            <pb ed="#L" n="115-r"/>
            and nevertheless 
            he did not will the act of sacrifice
            but rather the will and obedience of 
            <name ref="#Abraham">Abraham</name>
            and wished to prove and to show his faith.
            And in this way he commands and prohibits, permits, 
            counsels, fulfills.
