            After the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            determined about the visible mission of the Holy Spirit, 
            now he makes a determination about the invisible mission. 
            And this is divided into three parts. 
            I say this 
            because in the first he posits his intention 
            about charity and delight, 
            in the second place 
            he shows how charity 
            receives augmentation or intension, 
            in the third place he brings up the opposite opinion with its support. 
            The second begins at

              That this is not the case 
              is argued in the first place 
              because created charity 
              with the will sufficiently 
              produces some meritorious act,

              that by which the mind loves and earns merit 
              strays from the truth.

              In the third place, 
              nothing immeasurable is able to be 
              the intrinsic form of something measured, 
              therefore.
              The consequence is valid. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because subjective inherence is 
              repugnant to the unmeasured. 
              In the second place 
              because the measured
              then would have unmeasured justice formally, 
              which is repugnant,

              In opposition, 
              it is argued

              and to actuate for ordinate loving, 
              therefore the question is true.
              The consequence is good, 
              and the antecedent is clear

              First conclusion: 
              that created love is a habit supernaturally infused to the mind by God  
              actuating the mind in a special way,
              this making the mind beloved to God and God beloved to the mind 
              from the divine acceptance 
              actually or habitually <!-- still awkward here -->
              since it is partially causing some merit of the mind.
              This is proven in the first place 
              that the habit is supernaturally infused. 
              This is clear from

              is clear because 
              God is the life of the soul,

              The first corollary: 
              it stands that charity 
              actually informs the mind

              It is clear that created charity 
              does not incline unless moved 
              by the Holy Spirit 
              since this is its instrument 
              and also according to itself. 
              Whence he<!-- hugolinus --> says that 
              <!-- quote from hugolinus -->in meritorious work 
              uncreated charity 
              gives life, inclines, and operates, 
              but the potency or will only operates, 
              and the Holy Spirit does not actually move 
              except when it wishes the mind to act, 
              as is clear in

              nevertheless for something to be a meritorious act 
              is not in the power of human beings alone

              therefore.
              This is confirmed 
              because then the acts of the blessed would

              To the first against the second conclusion, 
              I say that all three of these reasons 
              are founded on something false, 
              namely that 
              the predestined person existing in mortal sin 
              is not accepted by God 
              and then afterwards is accepted, 
              which I do not concede.
              Indeed, 
              I say that 
              the predestined one 
              however much a sinner is always 
              and was from eternity 
              accepted by God for having eternal life.

              he posits a triple acceptance. 
              The first is the simple  
              agreeableness in which God accecepts every possible thing or future. 
              The second is the 
              efficacy and this is 
              that by which he wishes a thing to be in effect 
              and in way necessarily required for it, 
              and thus he accepts every existing thing.
              Third is a special acceptance 
              which is a volition ordered to a vow, 
              such that something greater is achieved 
              and this is perfective. 
              And this meaning about which is being spoken, 
              but not about the others, 
              as is clear from what has been said.

              is love informatively inhering in the mind, 
              but intrinsically and actuatively. 
              But whether the

              In the second place, 
              I say that he does not say that the Holy Spirit is made 
              or that charity is made absolutely, 
              but that 
              charity is made 
              or that Holy Spirit is made in the mind
              because it begins to be charity in the mind 
              and it began to be in the mind, 
              just as God began to be in the world, 
              nevertheless God never began to be. 
              Therefore it makes a big difference 
              to say that the Holy Spirit is made charity  
              and to say that charity is made in you 
              or that the Holy Spirit is made charity in you 
              because the second is true 
              and the first is false.

              To the fourth, 
              the antecedent is denied 
              because the will is not distinguished 
              from the essence of the soul, 
              at least really.
              In the second place, 
              I say that the consequence is not valid, 
              even among <name ref="#ThomasStrasbourg">Thomas of Strasbourg</name> 
              because has to concede 
              that some accident is able to have 
              many subjects, 
              and nevertheless they will be one in number 
              because according to him 
              the immediate  subject of the accidents is 
              the quantity itself 
              and the principal subject is substance 
              and these are distinguished between themselves.
              Thus similarly, 
              having posited 
              that the will would be distinguished from the soul to this, 
              the will is able to be the immediate subject of grace 
              and the essence the principal subjec ot the soul, 
              and thus it would be possible to be named by each name.

            The first conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit , 
            who is God 
            and also intrinsically 
            three persons 
            from the Father 
            and from the Son 
            and from itself, 
            proceeds temporally

            Second conclusion: 
            that the Holy Spirit is the love or charity 
            by which we love God and our neighbor 
            which charity is thus in us 
            with the result that it makes us to love 
            God, and our neighbor, 
            then the Holy Spirit is said to be sent or to be given to us

            love

            The fourth conclusion:

            and our patience, 
            not because he is these, 
            but because these are from God, 
            nevertheless God is not called charity in this way  
            because he is this charity itself, 
            therefore it is able to be said that 
            God or the Holy Spirit is the charity 
            by which we love God, 
            such that this ablative <mentioned>by which</mentioned>
