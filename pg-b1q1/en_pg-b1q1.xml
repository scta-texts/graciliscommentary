            The first part is able to be divided into three parts
            according to which the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> posits three causes 
            detracting him from the compilation of this work.
            The first is the subtlety of the science itself. 
            The second is the difficulty of the material. 
            The third is the sting of envy.
            In the second part he puts three causes urging 
            and inducing him to the compilation of this book.
            The first is the example of the poor widow. 
            The second is the hope of an eternal reward. 
            The third is the constant request of his companions.
            In the third part he compares the aforesaid causes to one another 
            by showing the victory of the motivating causes. 
            The second part begins at,

            Any of the other causes are able to be divided, but this division suffices for now.
            And this last cause is divided into three. For in the first part, 
            the evidence of the opposition of the enemies is stated.
            In the second, the reason for the opposition is stated.
            In the third, the wickedness of those opposing is stated.

            which is divided into three according 
            to a threefold schema 
            for inciting the hearer to complete the book.
            For in the first place 
            the hearer is enticed by the useful brevity, 
            second by the humble truth, 
            third by the exposure of falsity.

            This is the division of the prologue in general.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q1-isvioa">
            But the <name>Master</name> proceeds more specifically since he first puts one cause 
            moving him to the compilation of this book which is the desire of completing it 
            and immediately he adds the cause drawing him away from it,
            which is the lack of talent and knowledge.
            After these things, he identifies a cause drawing him away which is the loftiness of the subject matter
            and the magnitude of the labor, 
            and immediately he includes the contrary moving cause 
            which is the confidence of divine help and the prize promised by Christ. 
            After these things, he points out the victory of the moving causes by saying 
            that the intense love which he has for the church, which inflames him to compile this work, 
            conquers the two things which seem to draw him away from the compilation of it.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q1-iapipv">
            In another part, he says that he turns his attention to three things. 
            First regarding the defense of the catholic faith, 
            second regarding the truth of theological explanation, 
            third regarding the manifestation of the sacraments.
            After these things, he puts another moving<!-- should be moventem in latin text --> 
            which is the love <!--conirm with john that this is caritas --> and presence <!-- should be instantia not instantiam in latin text --> 
            of brothers and colleagues, and <!-- should be "et" not "est" --> immediately he adds a third contrary cause drawing him away which 
            is the sting and contradiction of critics <!-- i like critics for invidorum -->. 
            After this he puts the cause of contradiction which is 
            the discord and disorderedness of the will from which error comes and from error hate <!-- hate for invidia rather than "envy", change earlier instances -->
            and from hate arises contradiction. After this he points out the wickedness of the ones contradicting since, namely, 
            they do not subject the will to reason and they do not follow the right reason 
            nor do they wish to submit themselves to the authority of sacred scripture. 
            Rather to both reason and the authority of scripture they propose their own sense 
            and by some superstitious religion externally simulated they have an argument 
            for showing a new wisdom, 
            by devising some 
            doctrine and by some loud intention fighting stubbornly against the truth.
            After this he assigns the causes of the work. In the first place 
            he touches the final cause which is twofold, 
            namely the turning of the church from falsity or evil things and the manifestation of catholic truth.
            After this he puts the efficient cause which is twofold, 
            namely the principle cause which is God and the instrumental cause 
            which is the <name ref="#Lombard">Magister</name> himself.
            After he puts the material cause, 
            namely the testimony of truth of the canons and saints. 
            After this, he touches the formal cause which is twofold, 
            namely the form of the treatise which consists in 
            a division of the work through books and chapters; 
            the other is the form of treating, which is the same as the mode of acting.
            After this he says that in each book he puts forward chapters for an easier and lighter entrance or introduction.
            And thus the sentences of this prologue end here, 
            about which the following question is asked.

              That this is so in the first place because every natural potency is able to 
              perform <!-- perform for "exire" --> its own natural act, but the intellect is a natural potency
              and its own operation is to know and to understand, therefore it is able to assent naturally 
              to these truths without faith or the infusion of another light.
              This is confirmed because one is able to assent by the dictate of reason alone, 
              otherwise they would truly be able to assent to anything. The antecedent is true
              and the consequence is proved on the one hand because in the first place the

              and on the other hand in the second place because all things truly have a single (ratio) of acting on the intellect,

              truth with a special light, therefore also the pilgrim.

              In the third place, if the question turned out to be false,
              it would follows that some a light or special gift would be infused to some theologian.
              The consequent is false because no modern theologian perceives himself to be so infused.

              In the fourth place the pilgrim is able to convinced that there is a future life after this life
              by the command of reason alone, therefore.
              The consequence holds since this is a theological truth.
              The antecedent is true because just as the pursuit of a stone is to find a final place of rest, 
              so it is with human beings. But the pursuit of a stone, <unclear>which is found when these ends are acquired  <!-- something seems missing here --></unclear>,

              The minor is clear. The major is proved because human beings are not less ordered

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-pclecv">
              First conclusion: though theological assent is not distinct from a theological proposition, 
              nevertheless it is true that two propositions are formed of the same subject or predicate signifying the same thing 
              and are distinguished one from the other specifically.
              The first part is clear because, if they were distinguished, it would follow 
              that theological assent would be able to be without a theological proposition.
              The consequent is false because then someone would be able to assent 
              without complex knowledge which is contrary to the truth.
              The second part is proved because, if it were supposed that a believing person 
              formed the following proposition <mentioned>Christ has died</mentioned>
              and an unbelieving person formed the same proposition with respect to the terms, then 
              the faithful person assents to what is signified by this proposition 
              <unclear>when forming it</unclear>, and the unfaithful person does not assent,
              therefore they are specifically distinct. The consequence is clear because one is really and intrinsically 
              assent and the other is not, and nevertheless they have the same subject and predicate. 
              Therefore the conclusion is true. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-pcqnet">
              The first corollary: it is true that a person could know the entire holy scriptures 
              and not be a theologian. This is clear because if an unbelieving person knew 
              the scriptures, he would not be a theologian because he would not assent.
              This is confirmed because if the believing pilgrim knew and formed every proposition to which the unbeliever assented,
              he would despite this still be an infidel because he would consent to them. There for similar reason,
              the one know the Holy Scriptures and dissenting is not a theology.
              For this reason it should be known that infidelity is an assent with respect to what is false 
              or dissent with respect to what is determined to be true by the Church or revealed in Holy Scripture.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-scqeeh">
              The second corollary: it is true that the pilgrim could be informed with the theological 
              habit yet not be considered a theologian. From this is able to further inferred and conceded 
              that from the ordained law 
              <pb ed="#L" n="13-r"/> 
              the theologian is able to remain in faith, but is not always able t
              to remain or be a theologian without faith. From this it further follows that the <mentioned>theological</mentioned> 
              part is not as essential to the theological habit as the <mentioned>habit</mentioned>.
            </p> 
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-tcqdia">
              The third corollary: one indistinct proposition is able to have two contradictories 
              distinct in species. This is clear because the contradictory of a proposition is able to be 
              assent in the mind of one and dissent in the mind of another.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-scqsot">
              The second conclusion: though a theological proposition is theological cognition,
              nevertheless it is not necessarily knowledge by which someone is said to know 
              the total object of its own being. <!--  meaning is not entirely clear --> 
              The first part is proved because faith or theological knowledge do not differ from theological assent, 
              but theological assent is a theological proposition, therefore a theological proposition is theological knowledge or cognition.
              The major premise is clear because theological faith <!-- theological faith is a strange phrase, but "fides theologica" does appear to be a phrase mostly appearing in later 16th authors --> 
              is not able to be without theological assent, otherwise
              someone would believe something and not assent to it, which is false. 
              The minor is clear from the first conclusion. The second part is proved because 
              nothing is caused by itself, but our knowledge is at least partially caused by an object, 
              therefore this knowledge is not its own total object. <!--unsure about own total object -->
              This is confirmed because, suppose there was a vision that was a vision of itself, 
              it would still be required some object by which ti is caused. 
              Thus having supposed that the same thing is knowledge of itself, 
              nevertheless another object is required by which such knowledge is caused, and, as a consequence, 
              it is not its total object, which was the conclusion to be proved.

              Second corollary: theology or another science is not properly speaking known, 
              but is that by which something is known or cognized. This is clear through the fact that that which is known 
              is the object of the science, but science is not the object of itself, at least not the the total object, therefore.

              This is clear from the fundamental point since science is not properly known but is that by which something is known to be in this way or not.

              The third conclusion, though it is not impossible for the pilgrim to not believe any theological truths 
              and still have the act and habit of faith, nevertheless under the present law it is impossible that 
              the pilgrim assent to theological truths without any special light.
              The first part is proved in the first place regarding the habit. There is no doubt that 
              many have the habit of the virtues without that habit being put into act. <!-- this is similar to a brief discussion had by Holcot in question 1-->
              But that the act of faith is able to be without believing is proved because  the act of faith 
              and the actuation or the doing itself are not more identical than an accident and its adherence. 
              But God is able to make an accident without adherence, therefore.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-pcpiss">
              The first corollary: many are saved in the end who have never believed or never actually believe.
              This is clear when considering young children who die immediately after baptism. 
              Again this is clear when considering those being baptized how are lacking the use of reason, 
              like those who are born mentally impaired.
            </p> 
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-scmiss">
              The second corollary: many are blessed in the kingdom of heaven who, 
              if they had believed, would have been damned and would have been among the numbers of the reprobate 
              or in the place of the damned. This is clear from considering the young children of the 
              Greeks dying immediately <pb n="13-v" ed="#L"/> after baptism before the age of discretion.
              For it happens that the Greeks are baptized, though it is through a different form of words, 
              and as a consequence they receive the grace by which they are able to be saved. Nevertheless
              because the adult Greeks believe differently than the Roman Church believes and commands people to believe, 
              therefore they are not in the state of being saved.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-tchnqv">
              The third corollary: it is possible under the current law that the pilgrim 
              does not believe just as the church commands them to believe, and nevertheless 
              the pilgrim while believing in this manner in no way sins or is at fault of. Or it 
              is possible that some pilgrim is deficient in believing while not culpable and 
              nevertheless does not believe in the way the church commands that they should believe.
              This is clear because it is possible that someone can licitly believe nothing for a certain amount of time, 
              therefore it is possible that such a person does not err nor believe just as the Roman Church believes.
              From what has been said, it is clear that the negative part of the question true.

              Against the first conclusion it is first argued in the following way: 
              a theological proposition is able to exist without theological assent, 
              therefore it is distinguished. 
              The consequence is valid. The antecedent is proved because every proposition which 
              a believer is able to form is able to be formed by an unbeliever while remaining in 
              a state of unbelief. And since this unbeliever does not have the assent of a theological truth, 
              it follows that the theological proposition formed by this person is not intrinsically assent.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-ssqsqp">
              In the second place it follows that if a theologian were to become an infidel or heretic, 
              then he would lose the entirety of the theological science. The consequence is clear 
              because he would lose the assent to the theological propositions and such assent is 
              the theological science. But the falsity of this is proved since such a person would still know how to
              defend our faith,to read and dispute, and to solve arguments just as before, 
              since he does not know less than before.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-tpaeca">
              In the third place, we assent to a proposition through assent, 
              therefore theological assent is not a theological proposition.
              The consequence is clear because we do not assent to a proposition 
              by means of a proposition since, if this were the case, the same thing 
              would be that by which we assent and that to which we assent.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-qsiepm">
              In the fourth place, it is possible that a proposition exists 
              and assent to the proposition does not exist, therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved because a person is able to believe some proposition 
              to be true and later not believe, but rather believe the opposite on account 
              of some reasons, while the same proposition remains. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-qcstss">
              In the fifth place against the second part 
              it is argued because, if assent distinguished the type (species) of the proposition, then 
              if someone were to form the following proposition <mentioned>no man is an ass</mentioned>, 
              then it would follows that no one dissenting to this would be able to form a proposition of the 
              same type (species). The consequence is clear from the terms. The falsity is proved 
              because the one dissenting to this proposition is able to form a proposition
              of the same subject and predicate, therefore it is of the same type (species).
              This consequence is clear since propositions are nothing other than their terms taken together.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-sccqrd">
              In the sixth place against the corollary because either faith and theology 
              are the same habit or not. If they are the same, then the one having the theological habit has faith and 
              as a consequence is a theologian. If they are diverse, 
              then suppose that there is a remission of all things uniformly, equally, and precisely toward non-being, 
              then they either arrive equally at non-being or not. 
              If the first, then they are equal and consequently theology is not superior to faith which is false
              and against what

              In the seventh place against the second part of the second conclusion: everything

              therefore only a proposition is the total object of our science.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-occrea">
              In the eighth place against the corollary of the same conclusion because either the 
              total object of theology is a theological proposition or an external thing or the thing signified by the proposition.
              If the first, then the objection against the first corollary is sustained. The second option is not valid 
              because then there would be several sciences about contingent things being able
              <pb ed="#L" n="14-r"/> 
              to be disposed differently just as the sciences about objects, which is opposed to what the

              The third option is not valid for the same reason since 
              the proposition signifies a thing outside the soul.
              This is confirmed because by the same reasons some 
              external thing would be the object of an opinion, of faith, and of error, 
              and as a consequence it would mean that one and the same person 
              would know, opine, believe and be ignorant which are false. 
              The consequence is clear for it is true that a person knows that God is three and one, 
              opines that He alone moves the heavens, believes that He became incarnate, 
              and errs when thinking that He is of finite strength.

              In the ninth place against the third conclusion:
              theological truths are either self-evident or deduced from what is self-evident, 
              therefore for the knowledge of such things faith is not necessary.
              The antecedent is proved because no one would be obliged to believe without any doubt 
              something that is self-evident in and of itself or deduced from something self-evident, 
              but one is obliged to believe the theological truths without any doubt, therefore.
              The major premise is clear because every true thing is deduced or deducible from 
              a first principle since every true thing is virtually contained within it.

              the certitude of science. The consequent is false but the consequence is clear because

              In response to these arguments, to the first argument I say that a theological

              signifying a theological thing, 
              and thus a pure vocal proposition is able to be called theological.
              In another mode it is taken from a proposition which is intrinsically theological assent, 
              and thus I say that such a proposition, 
              which is the sign of the signified theological thing, 
              is not able to be without theological assent. And for the proof, what the argument 
              assumes is denied when taking the theological proposition in the second mode, though it is possible 
              to form any proposition signifying whatever one wants.

              as a habit by which one is able <unclear>to know how to conclude<!-- dbcheck this --></unclear> one proposition 
              from another, in such a case he would not lose the science, 
              but nevertheless such a person ought not to be called a theologian

              To the third argument, the antecedent is denied, and for the proof 
              it is said that the assent is the proposition itself by which we assent 
              not to the proposition but that reality is thus or is not thus. <!-- somewhat loose translation -->

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-aqnnmp">
              To the fourth argument, the antecedent is denied, and for the proof
              I say that as long as this proposition and assent will remain 
              so also will a similar proposition be able to remain which will not be assent, 
              and then this proposition is not a theological proposition, and thus it is able 
              to be said that this proposition will remain, but will not remain a proposition.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-aqcssa">
              To the fifth argument the consequent is conceded and for its proof
              the antecedent is conceded but the consequence is denied because
              the proposition which is an assent beyond the terms includes another assent, 
              namely an assent which is not included in the other. 
              In the second place it is able to be said that the copula of one is not of the same 
              type as the copula of the other because the mode of joining the subject and the predicate 
              is diverse since one proposition is assent while other is not, but only apprehension.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-asdqas">
              To the sixth argument it is said that they are not one habit.
              And since it is posited that they remit uniformly, perhaps someone would 
              say that they are not able to remit uniformly. But having admitted the case,
              it is said that some degree of theology will remain, but it would not properly 
              be called theology because without faith the habit would not be sufficient
              such that the one having could be said to have a theological habit. 
              And thus it is able to be said in <pb ed="#L" n="14-v"/>  
              conformity with what has been said above
              that theology is able to remain without faith, but one is not able to remain 
              in theology without faith, for this habit would not be sufficient such 
              that the one having it could be said to be to have the theological habit, at least according to 
              to present world order (law).
              Note that <name ref="AlphonsusVargas">Alphonsus</name> holds that

              To the seventh argument, which is against the second conclusion, 
              the minor is denied because many things are true which are not propositions 
              like the things signified by the propositions.
              And this appears to be the mind of  
              <cit>

              where he says that the thing signified by one contradictory <!-- should this be "contradictoriae" rather than "contradictione" --> proposition contradicts the thing signified by the other propositions,   
              and if one is true, the other is false. But the things signified by some extrinsic denomination assert (dicunt??) something either true or false 
              because the things signified by them are true or false or would be if they were formed. 
              And thus it is possible to say that the signified is true which is signifiable through a true proposition 
              and the signified is false which is signified through a false proposition. 
              Again it is able to be said that all true signifiable things are to be called 
              true from the first truth which is God who is the truth and certain judgment of all such things.

              To the eighth argument it is said that neither of the aforementioned (predicates),

              this is something, 
              it is said yes, 
              when taking <mentioned>thing</mentioned> loosely for 
              every complex or incomplex signifiable, 
              truly or falsely. 
              And when it is said that there would be 
              a science of contingent things, etc., 
              here it is said no, 
              therefore sciences are about necessary things 
              because their objects are real and necessary things and entities <unclear>since in this way there is nothing except God</unclear>. 
              But therefore they are said to be sciences about necessary things which are things which are known 
              to not be able to not to be thus.
              Consider for example, this knowable thing, <mentioned>every isosceles has three angles</mentioned>, etc.,
              is not said to be necessary because it is necessary that it is isosceles or that it necessarily has three, etc.,
              but because it is necessary that, if it is isosceles, it has three angles, etc.
              Further this knowable thing is said to be eternal because whenever an isosceles was, it had three, 
              and whenever it should exist, it will always have tree.
              With respect to the confirmation the consequent would be able to be conceded because 
              we know that the same God exists and we believe the term and we are perhaps able to err about Him 
              by holding some false opinion, and this according to diverse considerations and dispositions.
