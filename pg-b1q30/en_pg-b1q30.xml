            now in this distinction 38 he considers those things

            where the knowledge with respect to things is known 
            has this ratio and he offers a solution to this question, 
            in the second place from this solution 
            he introduces another doubt.

              First conclusion: 
              though it is repugnant 
              that the divine essence is not certain knowledge 
              of every knowable thing, 
              nevertheless it is not repugnant 
              that the divine essence 
              is not the foreknowledge of any knowable thing.
              The part is clear through what is said 
              because according to 
              <ref><name ref="#Paul">Apostolum</name></ref>, 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q30-Qd1e299" source="http://scta.info/resource/hebr4_13">

              </cit>.
              The second part is proved 
              since it is possible that nothing is the future, therefore
              The consequence is clear 
              because the divine foreknowledge 
              is nothing other than the divine essence, 
              as is evident 
              and infallible knowledge or certain judgement 
              with respect to the future 
              comprehending that this will be 
              in its very self, 
              and in the thing outside, 
              how it will be, 
              as is able to be drawn from 
              what is said by the
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q30-Rd1e316">
                  <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>,

                </ref>
              </cit>. 
              It is clear therefore 
              that, 
              if nothing were future, 
              the there would be no foreknowledge 
              or at least the foreknowledge 
              would be the divine essence of nothing, 
              since foreknowledge is only with respect t te future. 
              But the antecedent is clear 
              because a future thing 
              will be contingently and not necessarily, 
              as is clear below, 
              and consequently it is able not to be.
              It should be noted 
              that when we speak of <mentioned>foreknowledge</mentioned>,
              the word <mentioned>fore</mentioned>
              denotes an infinite delay of imaginary duration
              preceding the real existence of the future thing
              because God sees all things as if present 
              in the presence of eternity, 
              and therefore for God 
              nothing is future or futureness.

              First corollary: 
              though God is not able to be the knowledge of the future, 
              nevertheless God is able to not be the foreknowledge of the past.
              This is clear through the conclusion.
              It is confirmed 
              because at sometime it will be the present 
              and after the past, 
              and then it will not be foreknown 
              but known.

              The second corollary: 
              though the divine foreknowledge is the divine essence formally, 
              nevertheless for the divine essence to be foreknowledge is not a type of perfection absolutely. 
              This is clear 
              because there is able to not be foreknowledge 
              with respect of any future thing, 
              but it is not able not to be a perfection absolutely.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q30-d1e3372">
              Third corollary: 
              though that God is foreknowing 
              implies  
              <pb ed="#L" n="91-v"/>
              that there is some future, 
              nevertheless 
              that God is foreknowing
              does not imply 
              that God is this future.<!-- trans. check; "is" is more or less supplied here -->
              This is clear 
              because he is not effective of future guilt 
              and of the futureness of this guilt 
              since it is nothing. <!-- translation check; since it is nothing vs when there is nothing, when it is nothing -->
            </p>
            <!-- review para break -->
            <p xml:id="pgb1q30-d1e3387">
              The corollary stands that 
              something is and 
              at the same time 
              while it is not, 
              is able to be
              is not possible
              or thus the conclusion,
              when some contingent thing is
              it stands that that same thing 
              is able not to be. 
              This is proved 
              any created thing is contingently 
              and never contingently is unless while it is 
              because while it is not, 
              it is not contingently and not necessarily, 
              therefore it is contingently, 
              therefore while it is, 
              it is able not to be.
              In the second, 
              the corollary is proved 
              because the being of a creature 
              and the power of this same being to not be 
              are not contradictories, 
              therefore it stands that the 
              same thing at once is and is able not to be, 
              therefore.

              Second conclusion: 
              though nothing future is able to begin to be future, 
              nevertheless something future is able to not be future.
              The first part is proved 
              because whatever is or every will be future 
              was future from eternity,
              therefore nothing future is able to begin to be future.
              The consequence is clear 
              because, 
              if it is the case that future <c>a</c> began to be future, 
              it follows that from eternity 
              <c>a</c> was not future,
              which is the opposite of the antecedent.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because it was true, 
              at least for the uncreated truth, 
              that the antichrist will be 
              and also about anything else that will be.

              First corollary: 
              just as any future is contingently future, 
              so any future is known contingently by God to be future.
              The first part is clear 
              because any future will be contingently, 
              therefore etc.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because any such future 
              dependes or will depend on the liberty of the will. 
              The second part is proved 
              because 
              it follows, 
              future <c>a</c> is not 
              contingently known by God to be future, 
              therefore <c>a</c> necessarily will be or is future 
              which is repugnant to what has been said. 
              This is confirmed 
              because it follows that future <c>a</c> 
              is able to not be, 
              even though <c>a</c> will be, <!-- translation check "even though" for obstante -->
              therefore God is able to know 
              that <c>a</c> will not be, 
              even though he knows that <c>a</c> will be.

              The second corollary: 
              though it is true that the antichrist will be, 
              nevertheless no created or creatable thing will be the antichrist. 
              This is clear 
              because eternally 
              it was true to say that the antichrist will be, 
              but nothing created was eternally,
              therefore. 
              From this 
              it is clear that 
              no futureness or pastness 
              is able to be caused by God.
              This is proved 
              because pastness and futureness 
              are nothing, 
              therefore no such thing 
              is creatable or producible.

              Third corollary: 
              something known by God to be future 
              God is able never to have known to be future. 
              The corollary is clear 
              by dividing future against the present 
              and by taking it in the divided sense 
              because everything that will be 
              and is not and was not 
              was always contingently foreknown to be, 
              therefore every future is contingently known by God, 
              therefore it is able to never have been foreknown.

              From what has been said

              that any future, 
              when it is future, 
              continently is future.
              This is clear 
              because any future 
              is contingently future, 
              and not unless for the measure 
              for which it is future, 
              otherwise it would be some future 
              which would not be future, 
              which implies a contradiction.
              In the second place, 
              it follows that nothing is able to be future necessarily.
              This is clear

              the following consequence is not valid,

              therefore <c>a</c> will be necessarily. 
              This is clear because 
              that the antichrist wished in <c>b</c> 
              will be necessary when it happened, 
              and nevertheless 
              that the antichrist wished in <c>b</c> 
              is not a necessary future,

              Third conclusion:

              divine foreknowledge may stand

              This is proved because,

              Against the first conclusion: 
              any future necessarily is future, 
              therefore the divine essence is foreknowledge, etc.
              The consequence is valid, 
              and the antecedent is proved 
              by taking future <c>a</c> 
              and by arguing that it is necessary that 
              <c>a</c> is future, 
              therefore it is impossible that <c>a</c> will not be. 
              The consequence is clear, 
              and the antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              if it is not necessary but contingent, 
              then it follows its opposite is able to be true, 
              namely that this <c>a</c> is not future.
              Then it can be argued thus 
              that this is not true and it is able to be true, 
              therefore it is able to begin to be true. 
              The consequent is false, 
              just as that which is true 
              is not able to begin to be future, 
              so that which was always not-future 
              is not able to begin to be non-future.
              The consequences is proved 
              because, 
              if it has the potency, 
              such that it true 
              and now is not true, 
              then it follows that 
              it is able to begin to be true 
              because everything 
              that is able to be after non-being 
              or after another being

              In the second place, 
              it is further argued let it be posted 
              that God wishes future <c>a</c> to be 
              in instant <c>d</c> 
              and he wishes equally future <c>b</c> 
              after instant <c>d</c>.
              Then thus, 
              when instant <c>d</c> arrives 
              God equally wishes 
              <c>a</c> in <c>d</c> 
              and <c>b</c> after <c>d</c>. 
              But he is not able not to wish or to not have wished 
              <c>a</c> in <c>d</c>,
              therefore he is not able to not wish 
              <c>b</c> after <c>d</c>.
              This is clear 
              because before <c>d</c> he wishes equally 
              <c>a</c> and <c>b</c>, 
              as the case states,
              and the divine volition does not vary

              In the third place,

              in future instant <c>b</c>, 
              then when <c>b</c> comes, 
              just as it is necessary that
              in instant <c>b</c> and after <c>b</c> 
              <c>a</c> is,
              so it is impossible 
              that God is not its cause 
              which is that <c>b</c> will be.
              Therefore just as 
              the divine will is necessary 
              with respect to <c>a</c>, 
              so is it necessary

              In the fourth place,

              and he wishes that <c>a</c> will be in instant <c>b</c>, 
              then thus, 
              that <c>a</c> is not future in <c>b</c> is not compossible 
              with all the things which are now posited to be, 
              therefore for the following, 
              that <c>a</c> is not future, 
              it is necessary that there is some change in those things 
              which are posited as existing.
              But nothing exists 
              unless through the divine will or foreknowledge 
              as is posited in this case.
              But for change to occur in the divine foreknowledge or will 
              is impossible, 
              therefore that 
              <c>a</c> is not and was not at sometime future 
              implies a contradiction,

              for man to wish 
              it follows that God wishes, 
              nevertheless not as a power or causally.
              That I wish is the cause of why 
              God wishes or acts externally.

              To the first in the opposition, 
              the antecedent is denied. 
              And to the proof, 
              it is said 
              that he has from himself what is foreknowledge. 
              And when it is inferred, 
              therefore he is not able not to be foreknowledge, 
              the consequence is denied, 
              just as it does not follow, 
              the will has from itself that it wishes this object, 
              therefore it is not able not to wish it.

              In the second place, 
              it is said that the foreknowledge of God 
              does not have from itself what is foreknowledge 
              in such a way that 
              it is itself essentially foreknowledge of such a future, 
              in the same way that a triangle has from itself three angles.

              To the second,

              To the third, 
              I says that the consequence is necessary, 
              but I say that the consequent, 
              just as it is contingent, 
              so is the antecedent, 
              and also it does not follow, 
              it is eternal. 
              Therefore it is necessary 
              because 
              that it was from eternity 
              in some mode depends on the future, 
              therefore it is possible that it never was
              because, just as it is able not be, 
              similarly it is able never to have been foreknown 
              or even fore-willed.

            First conclusion: 
            the foreknowledge and knoweldge of God
            which is both good and bad things 
            are the causes of things
            except as a cause sine qua non, 
            and conversely things are not the causes of the knowledge of God
            except as a cause sine qua non 
            because it is not the case 
            that a thing exists 
            and that God is unaware or does not things.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q30-d1e4671">
            Second conclusion: 
            that if the word <mentioned>knowledge</mentioned> includes what is pleasing to God
            then the knowledge of God is the cause of all good things 
            but not of bad things 
            because respect to these latter things 
            he does not have them as something pleasing 
            but only as knowledge of foreknowledge.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q30-d1e4679">
            Third conclusion: 
            that the foreknowledge of God is not able to be deceived, 
            whence when it is said,
            things are not able to be or to occur 
            otherwise than as they have been foreknown by God,
            if this is understood conjunctively, 
            then these are true at the same time, 
            for it is not able to stand 
            that something should occur in one way 
            and that God should foreknow it in another.
            If this is understood 
            disjunctively,
            then it is false 
            because no contingent future occurs from necessity.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q30-d1e4695">
            It should be noted that 
            if in one way one is attentive to the otherness of divine cognition, 
            then in this way it does not know one thing differently than it knows another. 
            But if one is attentive to the otherness of things, 
            then in this way knows diverse things in different ways.
            And this suffices. <!-- translation check need on this paragraph -->
