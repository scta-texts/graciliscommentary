            after he proved the unity of the divine nature and trinity of the persons

            And divides it into three principal parts 
            because in the first place he proves this with reason and argument, 
            in the second place with through similarity and vestigial trace,

            The first part is divined into four parts because he proves his 
            intention with four arguments.

            in the second place from the mutability and deficiency of creatures, 
            in the third place from the goodness and excellence of the perfected,

            The second principal part is divided into three. 
            For in the first place it shows how the trace of all things is imprinted from the first art, 
            in the second place how the trace is known by the rational mind, in the third place how the

              That not because the human soul is not productive of its own acts, therefore etc.
              The consequence holds and is also proven because the human soul is not formally active, 
              as  
              <cit>

              Then in the second place because it is receptive of its acts and passive with respect to them, 
              therefore it is not active because then the same thing would be the agent and patient.

              In the second place, not every created thing is a vestige of the trinity, therefore
              the image the same Trinity is not able to found in the soul. 
              The consequence is clear because in the same way that the soul relates to the image, 
              so the every creature relates to the vestige. 
              The antecedent is clear because otherwise it would follow that anyone conceiving or seeing

              In the third, the human soul does not lead into  
              perfect knowledge of the Trinity, therefore it is not its image.
              The consequence is clear because, since an image is unitve of that of which it is an image,
              it leads into perfect knowledge of whatever trace. 
              The antecedent is proved because otherwise 
              we would have perfect knowledge about the uncreated Trinity

            <head xml:id="pg-b1q4-Hd1e3888">First conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e202">
              First conclusion: it is as repugnant to the human soul to not be intellective 
              as it is to not be formally active and receptive of its own acts. 
              This is proved because any rational creature is formally active and 
              receptive of its own acts, therefore. 
              The consequence is valid because what formally and instrinsically is something, 
              it is repugnant for it not to be this thing, if it exists.
              In the second place because the powers of the soul 
              and the soul are formally the same thing, as I now suppose, therefore etc.
              The antecedent is proved in the first place because, 
              according to 
              <cit>
                <ref>the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>, in book II</ref>
                <bibl>Lombardus, Sent. II, d.38 (I, 547-552).</bibl>
              </cit>
              the will is effective of its own acts, therefore it is either formally and intrinsically active in itself or
              
              <pb ed="#L" n="21-v"/> 
              or not.
              If it is, then the proposed is obtained. 
              If not, but it is active through another, then it is asked about this, just as before, 
              whether it is formally active or not. If it is, then it follows that it was equally standum? 
              as in the first place. If not, then there will be a process into infinity, which is false.
              This is confirmed because the soul therefore is active of its vital acts 
              because it is the life of the body, therefore it is formally active.
              The consequence is valid 
              and the antecedent is clear through 
              <cit>
                <ref>
                  the <name ref="#Aristotle">Philosopher</name> in book II of <title ref="#deAnima">De anima</title>
                </ref>
                <bibl>Aristotle, De anima, II</bibl>
              </cit>. 
              But that the soul is receptive of its own acts is clear because otherwise 
              there would be no enduring elicited acts. 
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear because so many ancients 
              denied that the soul is the effective cause of its own act
              because then the same thing would be agent and patient, moving and moved, 
              which is thought to be inconvenient.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e232">
              The first corollary: it follows from what has been said in the conclusion,
              the parts of the image belonging to the human soul lack real plurality. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-scsaaf">
              The second corollary: it stands that the perceptive potency is formally active, 
              and nevertheless to perceive is not to act formally.
              This is clear because 
              the fact that <mentioned>God is</mentioned> is not formally the fact that <mentioned>God creates</mentioned>, 
              and nevertheless God is formally creative. Again, 
              to perceive oneself is not to act on oneself, and nevertheless the same thing is 
              formally the perceptive potency of itself and formally active of another.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e242">
              The third corollary: though any perceptive 
              potency is formally active, nevertheless not every active potency is 
              formally perceptive.
              This is clear because the perceptive is below the active power. 
              Again, fire is active and nevertheless it is not perceptive of some object.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e250">
              Another corollary: if some receptive or passive power is a denomination, <!-- not sure how to translate this -->
              than any angel is less perfect than any one who is just a person. <!-- i translated "putus" as "just" -->
              Indeed it follows that the human soul is more perfect than any angel. 
              This is clear because the angel is of a greater capacity than the human soul, 
              therefore the angel is less perfect? since the capacity of an angel and man is 
              the receptive passive power. Indeed it follows that however more perfect the soul is, 
              the less perfect it is because it implies etc.
              This is clear since the soul is its capacity, 
              therefore what ever amount of capacity it has, this is its degree of essential perfection.
              Therefore the more capacity it has, the more perfection it has.
              Or for the other perspective, the more capacity it has, the more receptive it is and the more passive it is, 
              and the passive and receptive it is, the more imperfect is it is, therefore proposed is obtained. 
            </p>

            <head xml:id="pg-b1q4-Hd1e4012">Second conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e272">
              The second conclusion: Though any supposite of a created entity carries the trace 
              of the Blessed Trinity, nevertheless it is the case that from the consideration of this trace 
              and also from the same thing <!-- not sure how to translate this --> 
              a concept of the Trinity is not obtained.
              The first is clear in this distinction because any supposite has a unity, a charm, 
              and a goodness.
              The unity represents the Father because, just as unity is beginning of number, 
              so the Father is the beginning of the Trinity and the fontal origin. 
              Charm or beauty represents the Son upon which, as an exemplar, 
              the beauty of every creature is formed.
              Goodness truly represents the Holy Spirit, which is the love of the Father and the Son, 
              the one from who every good thing proceeds.
              The second is proved because it is the case that the consideration of the 
              trace is to speculate about it or consider it not under the ratio qua trace, 
              and this does not bring one back to the Trinity.
              This is clear because otherwise whoever knows
              <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name>, 
              who is a father, would know his son, which is false.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e288">
              The first corollary: though it stands that to consider 
              the created entity from another also does not bring knowledge of the Trinity, 
              nevertheless any created entity represents the Blessed Trinity more perfectly 
              than the entity itself. 
              The first part is clear through the conclusion. 
              The second is proved when speaking about 
              representation as the creature is perfectively intuitively 
              seen according to the degree of its perfection
              because it is suited to the Trinity in the first place through its unity, 
              charm, and goodness, and every perfection without exception. 
              Therefore the consequence is clear because in these things 
              consists the perfection of the creature.
            </p> 
            <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e298">
              The second corollary: when the trace under the ratio
              <pb ed="#L" n="22-r"/>

              some contemplation of the Trinity in the mind is produced or conceived. 
              This is clear because the trace and the thing traced are correlative,
              therefore the cognition of one thing under the ratio of relativity 
              introduces the cognition of the other.

              Third conclusion: just as the soul is the effective cause or 
              effectively causative of its own acts, so the same thing is subjectively receptive of its own acts. 
              This conclusion is clear through what has been said in the first conclusion, 
              nevertheless the first part is proved in another way.
              Any created thing has some formal effective principal of its own beginning, 
              therefore acts of the soul have a beginning of this type.
              But it seems that no such thing should be posited besides the soul, 
              therefore. It is confirmed, the will is the cause, therefore also the soul.
              The consequence is proved because the will is one mind, one substance, one life,

              The consequence is clear, but the antecedent is proved because, 
              if this were true, it would follow that in God it would be the same thing formally

              In the second place, an intellective or perceptive power adds something above an active power, 
              therefore they are not formally the same.
              The consequence is valid and the antecedent is proved 
              because, as it was said in the third corollary, 
              fire is active but not perceptive.
              This is also clear because to be active is a common property common both to
              a vital power as well as to a non vital power, but a merely perceptive power. 
              This is confirmed because that which is perceptive 
              adds that which is active, therefore it is either formally active or not. <!-- I supplied the or not -->
              If it, is then it follows that the perceptive power <supplied>is active</supplied>,

              any non perceptive active power is active. 
              The consequent is false. If it is not formally active, 
              but is that by which an animal or something is formally perceptive, 
              then it is perceptive, and thus it is not an active being, as proposed,

              In the third place, if the perceptive power is formally an active power,

              Not the first mode nor the second because any real active power speaks 
              a greater perfection in reality an intentional active power. 
              However not any real active power is of a greater perfection than 
              a formally active intentional power, namely a perceptive power.

              To the first against the second conclusion it is said, 
              I concede the entire argument, 
              namely that the one seeing the vestige of the trinity forms a concept of God in the mind, 
              and most especially if they consider the vestige under the ration qua vestige, as the corollary says.

              thus it is not necessary to have a concept of the substance.

              For the solution, note that having a concept of God is possible in two ways, 
              namely virtually and formally. Virtually indeed when by virtue of it one is able to have 
              a formal concept, formally when through such a formal concept God is signified. 
              Again, this is able to happen 
              perceptibly or imperceptibly, such that the former whenever the act of beginning is perceived 
              and the thing is conceived, 
              and the latter whenever the act of beginning is perceived and the thing is not conceived.

            etc. 
            This third distinction contains eleven conclusions.
            First, that man on account of the excellence by which he excels 
            over other creatures or on account of the fittingness which 
            he has with every creature, is said to be a creature of the world and 
            is suited for knowing the divine truth, for which cognition
            he is helped by two things, namely by his proper nature, which is rational, 
            and by the works done by God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e90">
            The second conclusion: God, who is by nature incomprehensible or invisible through creatures, 
            is able to be known by man. And in order to prove this the Master offers four arguments. 
            The first can be formulated as follows: something is above every creature and is God 
            which makes that which no creature is able to make. But God makes 
            that which no creature is able to make, namely the heaves and the earth, therefore he is God.
            Therefore through cognition of effects, one is led to the cognition of that which is God is.
            The second argument: every changeable and imperfect thing shows something 
            unchangeable and perfect by which it is perfected.
            But every creature is imperfect and changeable, 
            therefore every such thing shows something unchangeable and that is God, therefore etc.
            The third argument: wherever there is the good and the better and the best, 
            we make a judgement about the goodness of these things through such a comparison.
            But in creatures we see one thing to be better than an another, 
            therefore it is necessary to identify something that is the best and this is God, therefore etc.
            The fourth argument: where there is a greater and lesser pledge, <!-- not sure how to translate sponsum here -->
            there should be asserted a most pledged. But one creature is more pledged than another, therefore 
            this is to a assert a most pledged and this is God, therefore.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e153">
            The third conclusion: God, who is of the highest simplicity in his essence, 
            is understood to be eternal from the perpetuity of creatures,
            omnipotent from the magnitude of creatures, wise from their disposition, 
            and good from their governance.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e161">
            The fourth conclusion: the vestige of the trinity appears in a creature 
            because any creature is some one thing having a likeness or beauty 
            and has order, love, and goodness. 
            Unity, which is the principle of number, represents the Father, who 
            is the principle of the origin of the other two persons, 
            namely the of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
            But species or beauty represents the Son, 
            who is beauty and that according to which, just as an exemplar, 
            every creature is formed. 
            And order represents the Holy Spirit, 
            who is the highest goodness and love of the Father and of the Son
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e182">
            The fifth conclusion: 
            One is not able to have sufficient knowledge of scripture through the contemplation of scripture 
            without doctrine and divine inspiration or revelation.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e193">
            Sixth conclusion: that our soul is 
            the image of the Trinity because just as in the Trinity <!-- I've added a bit here --> there is in the soul 
            memory, intelligence, and will, each of which is not the other
            and nevertheless they refer to one another and are equal, not merely one to another, 
            but also each individual is equal to all the others, 
            nevertheless there is one life, one essence, just as all three persons in the divine 
            are both one essence and one substance.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e210">
            Seventh conclusion: though in our mind there is the image of the Trinity, 
            nevertheless it meager and for the most dissimilar. For one man has
            these three parts and nevertheless a man is not three things.
            But God is three persons and three persons are one.
            Again, one person, namely one man, has three parts, but the highest trinity is not truly 
            a person, but three persons. Again, these three are not one man, but of one man, but in God
            these three are of one God, but one God.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e229">
            Eight conclusion: that in a different way
            <pb ed="#L" n="24-r"/> 
            the image of the trinity is found in the soul.
            For there is mind and love, such that knowledge is 
            as if a kind of offspring generate from the mind as if a parent 
            because, when the mind knows itself, 
            it gives birth to knowledge of itself. Thirdly 
            there is love which proceeds from knowledge and the mind itself 
            since, when the mind knows itself, it loves itself and its offspring, 
            namely its knowledge
            The <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> also adds that these three things are 
            equal in one substance of the soul and therefore the human mind, 
            while considering these things, extends itself to the contemplation of the creator 
            sees unity in the Trinity and the Trinity in the unity of one essence.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e252">
            Ninth conclusion: that our mind ought to understand one God, 
            one essence, one principle, and that this is the actor behind all things 
            because if two there were two Gods, then either each would be insufficient 
            or one would be superfluous.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e260">
            Tenth conclusion: we ought to believe
            that the Father and the Son and Holy Spirit are the founder and builder of the 
            universe of creatures, and that the Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit 
            and the Son is not the Father or the Holy Spirit, 
            and the Holy Spirit is not the Father or the Son, 
            but they are a trinity of persons relative to one another.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q4-d1e270">
            The eleventh conclusion: the faith of the Patriarchs and of the Apostles preaches 
            that the one God is a Trinity in which Trinity 
            there is one Father, who alone as God generates from himself one Son, and one Son, 
            who alone from the one Father is essentially born, and one Holy Spirit, 
            who alone proceeds from the Father and the Son.
            The
            <name xml:id="pg-b1q4-Nd1e1629" ref="#Lombard">Master</name> also adds in the end 
            that this proposition ought not to be absolutely conceded 
            <mentioned>God begot God himself or another God</mentioned>, 
            and thus it was said regarding this question.
