            This distinction 19 continues the preceding thus 
            because after 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Lombard</name> 
            determined about the identity of the persons with a real distinction 
            or eternal duration, 
            now he begins to treat 
            about the coequal perfection of the persons.
            And he divides it into three 
            because in the first place he shows 
            in what things it consists 
            and with respect to what 
            their equality applies in 
            <pb ed="#L" n="63-v"/>
            general,
            in the second place he shows specifically those things 
            in which they are equal not from a real difference, <!-- translation check -->
            in the third place he considers one of predicates specifically. <!-- translation check for "unoquoque" -->

              That not because no divine supposite is immeasurably perfect

              because, 
              just as one is not the other, 
              so the perfection of one is not the perfection of the other 
              because then there would several immeasurably perfect things, 
              one of which would not be the other.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3161">
              In the second place,
              the divine supposites are distinguished from 
              one another by their related properties 
              and by the perfection attributes, 
              therefore they are not distinction from them.
              The consequence holds 
              because these personal properties are not divine supposites, 
              as is seen.

              In the third place,

              are infinitely distinguished in small ways, <!-- translation check on "modice" -->
              therefore. 
              The consequence holds 
              because it does not seem compossible 
              that something is infinitely such in small ways 
              and infinitely such. 
              But the antecedent is clear 
              because the divine supposites 
              are distinguished 
              by a real personal distinction 
              which is the smallest possible distinction.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3188">
              In opposition, 
              it is argued 
              because the divine supposites 
              are distinguished in such a way 
              that in no mode are they able to be the same suppositionally 
              and not another thing from themselves, therefore. 
              The consequence holds 
              because the degree to which identity is repugnant to distinction, 
              to the same degree do they seem to be distinguished among themselves. 
              The first part of the antecedent is clear 
              because by how much necessity God is God, 
              by the same necessity are the three divine supposites. 
              The second part is clear 
              because, 
              if so, 
              it would follows 
              that in the divine essence 
              there would be a quaternity.

              First conclusion
            </head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3219">
              The first conclusion: 
              any divinal supposite 
              is immeasurably perfect and equal to the other.
              The proof is 
              because between divine supposites 
              there is the highest essential identity of perfection of many things,
              therefore. 
              The consequence holds 
              because the highest essential identity of several distinctions 
              is the highest equality of them.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because a greater essential identity of several things 
              than the identity of the divine supposites 
              is not able to be imagined.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3270">
              The first corollary: 
              though supposite being is determined under no perfection, 
              nevertheless the uncreated supposite being is of an immeasurabley perfection. 
              The first part is clear 
              because, 
              if so, 
              the Son would not have every perfection of the Father, 
              nor the converse, 
              which is false.
              The second part is clear through the conclusion.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3280">
              The second corollary:
              no created simple thing or composite 
              is able to be as equal to another 
              as the divine supposites. 
              This is clear 
              because no plural created things 
              are as much the same as the divine supposites are the same
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3288">
              Third corollary: 
              though the equality or identity of any equal things of the creator
              is infinitely less than the identity of the divine supposites,
              nevertheless it is not repugnant according to some denomination 
              that only one is the similitude of similar composites. 
              The first is clear 
              because otherwise the identity of the divine supposits 
              would not be the highest possible identity from nature, 
              which is contra to what has been said. 
              The second part is proved 
              because from the absolute power of God 
              the same whiteness would be able to inform 
              two distinct substances. 
              And consequently this would return similar things 
              and designate white things.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3330">
              Second conclusion: 
              just as no divine supposite 
              is distinguished from its personal property, 
              so no divine supposite is distinguished 
              from the essential or attributable perfection.
              The first is proved by taking <mentioned>supposite</mentioned>
              with the inclusion of the origin, 
              and this is clear through

              The conclusion is clear, 
              and these words are treated below 
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q20-Rd1e271">

                <bibl>XXX</bibl>
              </cit>.
              The second part is proved 
              because attributal perfection is the essence itself 
              imported into many things 
              <pb ed="#L" n="64-r"/>
              through a term generally importing a perfection 
              absolutely common to the creator and to the creature 
              according to some analogy 
              from a revealing investigation of creatures into the creature, 
              like wisdom, justice, goodness, and others of this type.
              But any divine supposite is formally ad really 
              justice, goodness, wisdom, and things of this type, 
              therefore no divine supposite 
              is distinguished from attributal perfection. 
              The first part of the antecedent is clear 
              through the description of the attribute or 
              the attributal perfection,
              which is able to drawn out from what is said by  
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q20-Rd1e287">
                  <name ref="#ThomasStrasbourg">Thomas of Strasbourg</name>,
                  in distinction 6 of the first book,

                <bibl>Thomas de Argentina, I, d. 6, q. 1, a. 1</bibl>
              </cit>.
              Through that which is said generally signifying absolute perfection 
              they differ from notions 
              because, 
              though the generating Father is a kind of perfection absolutely, 
              nevertheless it is not generally 
              because then it would be a perfection in the Son or Holy Spirit. 
              Through that which is said to God and to creature 
              they differ from those things which are not 
              and are not able to be suitable to creatures, 
              like deity, immensity, etc. 
              But through that which is said according 
              to some analogy
              they differ from those things 
              which we only believe by faith to suit God, 
              and to depend on his free will alone, 
              like to become a man, to be born, to suffer, etc.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e3423">
              First corollary: 
              because the will, intellect, goodness, 
              and attributal perfections of this kind 
              are not and they do not indicate distinct formalities in God. 
              This is clear because 
              otherwise there would be an infinite process 
              in formalities, <!-- dbheck "in formalitatibus" -->
              which is false.
              The consequence is clear 
              because, 
              if wisdom is formally distinguished from the will, 
              therefore let this distinct formality be <c>a</c>, 
              and it follows that <c>a</c> 
              has another formality, 
              and then it is asked whether 
              this is distinguished from that or that, 
              as before, 
              and thus there will be a proceeding into infinity or 
              there will be admitted that somethings are distinguished formally 
              and they do not have diverse formalities.

              Second corollary: 
              every attributable divine perfection within it
              is formally the same and absolutely equal. 
              This is clear.

              Third corollary: 
              though attributes of this type are not pluralized 
              nor distinguished from the nature of things, 
              nevertheless a distinction of reason is had between them 
              or is taken up through the operation of our intellect. 
              The first is clear from what has been said. 
              The second is proved

              Third conclusion: 
              just as equality among many created things 
              recognizable in the equality of the divine supposites
              is properly incomparable, 
              so the personal distinction of the same divine supposites
              is disproportional to every other distinction.
              The first is clear through what has been said 
              since in no case are several created things 
              as essentially the same 
              as these divine supposites 
              are essentially the same. 
              The second part is proved 
              because this personal distinction 
              in a line of distinctions is not of some quantity, 
              since it is the smallest possible.
              And in the second place 
              because no distinction recognizable among created things 
              is of the same ratio with this, 
              therefore this is disproportional from one to other.

              The first corollary: 
              just as two divine supposites are not something greater than one, 
              so one of them is not less distinguished from one
              than from the remaining two. 
              This is clear

              nevertheless we do not say properly that this distinction 
              will be greater, lesser, or equal to the divine distinction.
              This is clear because they are of diverse rationes 
              and infinitely and incompossibly disproportionate 
              because it is impossible 
              that one person is another.

            First conclusion: 
            that according to the catholic faith 
            there are three coeternal and coequal divine persons 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4000">
            Second conclusion: 
            that none of the divine persons 
            precede the other in eternity 
            or exceed the other in magnitude 
            or surpass the other in power.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-tcqsei">
            The third conclusion: 
            that though these three, 
            namely eternity, magnitude, and power 
            are enumerated as if diverse things in God, 
            nevertheless they are one and the same, 
            namely the divine essence, simple, and unchangeable. 
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4012">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that the Father is not greater than the Son, 
            nor are the Father and the Son greater than the Holy Spirit, 
            nor two persons a greater something at the same time than one, <!-- translation check, esp "simul" -->
            and nor is a three something greater than two, 
            nor is the essence greater in two or three things 
            than in one because the whole is in the individuals.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4022">
            The fifth conclusion: 
            that the Son is in the Father 
            and the Father in the Son 
            and the Holy Spirit in each 
            and the individuals in the individuals 
            on account of the unity of the divine nature.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4028">
            Sixth conclusion: 
            that none of the three divine persons 
            is part of the divine being or the divine essence 
            because each of them is the true and full God 
            and likewise is the whole and full divine essence , 
            and therefore none of them in the trinity is a part.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4036">
            Seventh conclusion: 
            is that three divine persons are said to be one essence, 
            not according to a material cause, 
            as three statues are said to be one gold, 
            nor on account of the likeness of complexion, 
            as three men are said to be of one nature or sex, 
            nor is the divine essence predicated of the divine persons, 
            as a genus of a species, 
            nor as a species of individuals, 
            nor as something containing of things contained, 
            nor as greater of lesser things.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q20-d1e4053">
            Eight conclusion: 
            God is said to be triune or a trinity, 
            but by this he is not said to be threefold, 
            for there is not triplicity 
            where there is the highest unity 
            and indifferent equality. 
            However in bodily things one is not as much as three at the same time 
            and two things are more than one, 
            but in the highest Trinity one person is as much as three at the same time 
            and two are as much as one 
            and infinity 
            because there is no end of their magnitude.
