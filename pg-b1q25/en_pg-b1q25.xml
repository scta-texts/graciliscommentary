            After the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            treated the eternal notions intrinsic to persons, 
            now he begins to treat the temporal and extrinsic relations.
            And this is divided in two 
            because in the first place he treats about those things 
            which are said extrinsically about any person from time, 
            in the second place about those things 
            which belong to the persons commmonly and appropriately.

            Regarding these two distinctions, 
            it is asked whether the highest independent thing 
            relates to something contingent; 
            whether the simple invariable triune relates to something contingent or producible; 
            whether through what is produced it is able to formally inferred 
            that God is really and truly related to created things. <!-- not sure about translation here, using "related" for "referetur" -->

            <p xml:id="pgb1q25-qndaid">
              That God does not depend on 
              something contingent, producible, or temporally produced, 
              therefore he does not really relate to any such thing.
              The antecedent is known, 
              and the consequence is clear 
              because, what relates to another things, 
              depends on that thing.

              In the second place, 
              if this is so, 
              then either this would be a relation distinct from itself
              and from any absolute thing 
              or it would be related to itself.
              Not the first 
              because when a relation is related to God, 
              it follows that there is a relation of the relation, 
              and thus there would be a process into infinity in relations, 
              which is false. 
              Again, 
              it follows that 
              which mediates the relation between God and the producible 
              would be in God. 
              The consequent is false 
              because God is not the subject of any accident. 
              And the consequence is clear 
              because non-being is not able to be the subject of an accident. 
              Nor the second 
              because by the same reason 
              any created thing would be related 
              to what is different than itself, 
              which is false 
              because every related thing 
              is distinct from the absolute thing.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q25-d1e3253">
              In the third place, 
              either God is related to this 
              by a temporal relation 
              or an eternal relation. 
              Not the first 
              because then God would change. 
              This is clear through the

                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q25-Rd1e267">

              where he wishes that 
              when something genuinely new comes into being 
              related through the change of another 
              each is changed through an accident or
              by the relative change. 
              And the second is not able to be said 
              because  
              no creature was eternally, 
              but a real relation is not able to be 
              between two extremes 
              unless they are really positive, 
              therefore.

              In opposition, 
              it is argued that God knew from eternity 
              that would produce a creature, 
              therefore the question is true.
              The consequence holds 
              because the one knowing and the knowable or thing known 
              relate to one another.
              And the about the antecedent
              there is no doubt 
              because God does not begin to know anything in time.

              First conclusion: 
              though God is related to created things from time or temporally, 
              nevertheless anything to which God relates temporally 
              was already related from eternity or eternally.
              The first part is clear because 
              God is the creator from time 
              and really the lord of creation, <!-- creation for "creaturae --> 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear through the 
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q25-Rd1e317">
                  <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>,

                </ref>
                <bibl>

              And the consequence is clear 
              because a lord is related to his servant 
              and the lord is not a lord before  
              his servant exists.
              The second part is proved 
              because God was eternally foreknowing and productive of what is producible, 
              therefore he was eternally related 
              creatable and knowable being. 
              The consequence is clear 
              the creative and creatable, 
              the knowing and the knowable are correlative. 
              But that is a real relation 
              and not a relation of reason only
              because having removed every operation of any created thing, 
              it remains that the case that God is creating 
              and the lord of creation 
              and he is related to whatever is producible.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q25-d1e3327">
              The first corollary: 
              just it is not repugnant 
              that real being is related to something 
              that lacks actual being, 
              so it is not repugnant 
              that non-being is related to the highest necessity. 
              The first part is clear 
              because memory is of things absent 
              and of things past, 
              therefore being is related to non-being.
              The consequence holds 
              because memory is called memory, 
              as is clear through
              <cit>

              The antecedent is clear from the

              This part is confirmed 
              because the image of a rose 
              existing on a wall 
              or in the memorative power 
              is equally an image of a rose 
              when it is present 
              while it is nonetheless not present, 
              therefore being is related to non-being. 
              The consequence is clear because  
              <pb ed="#L" n="77-v"/> 
              the image inasmuch as it is an image 
              is something related.
              The second part is proved 
              because being is related to non-being, 
              therefore.
              The consequence holds 
              because relatives are called convertences, <!-- not sure how to translate "convertences" -->
              and the antecedent is clear 
              from the conclusion and from the position 
              of its first part

            <p xml:id="pgb1q25-d1e3413">
              Second corollary: 
              though it is impossible
              that created existing entities 
              do not have dependence, 
              nevertheless not everything having dependence on something 
              is a real entity in existence.
              The first part is clear

              Second conclusion: 
              though any discoverable relation 
              between created beings is 
              somehow really distinct from everything thing, 
              nevertheless no such relation apart from the absolute thing 
              is able to be distinctly understood.
              The first part is proved 
              because a real relation 
              and an absolute thing 
              or a realted thing and an absolute thing,
              as thus are really found in diverse categories, 
              since they differ not only number and species, 
              but also in genus, 
              therefore. 
              ergo. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because relation is a category 
              distinct from another from itself. 
              The second part is proved 
              because, 
              if the relation of father and son 
              were ale to be conceived 
              without any thing distinctly absolute, 
              it follows that 
              someone would be able 
              to know for themselves that something is father 
              and not know that he has a son.
              Again,
              it would be possible to know that 
              <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name> is similar
              to not be aware of whether 
              it is similar to something, 
              indeed one would not even know
              <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name>, 
              since <name ref="#Sortes">Socrates</name>
              is an absolute thing. 
              But these things should not be conceded,

              because,

              but only secundum quid. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because what depends through another 
              only depends secundum quid.
              In the third place, 
              the same antecedent is proved
              because, 
              if a stone were to depend on itself with a distinct dependence,
              <pb ed="#L" n="78-v"/>
              it would follow that the dependence of a stone, 
              which depends itself, 
              would more greatly depend on God than the stone does.
              The consequent is false 
              because each depends causally.
              The consequence is proved 
              because what depends in itself 
              depends first and principally, 
              but what depends in another 
              does not depend on the first, 
              but from the consequent.

              therefore the relation without any absolute thing. 
              The consequence holds 
              because understanding of one disparate thing

              on the understanding of its cause. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because someone is able to know 
              that something is the father 
              and not know whether it has a son,

              only a relation of reason, therefore it is posterior

              that the thing,

            The first conclusion of the distinction 31: 
            that nothing is called similar or equal to itself, 
            but the three divine persons are said to be 
            equal to one another and relatively similar

            Second conclusion:

            are called equal and similar,

            but according to the unity of the essence, 
            nevertheless the Son is not equal to the Father 
            from the fact that the he is the Son, 
            but according that which is said about itself, 
            that is the substance and virtue and nature, 
            for the equality is the identity of virtue.

            Similarly, 
            he is said to be simple

            it is a gift of the Father and the Son,
