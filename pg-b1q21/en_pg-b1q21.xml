              And again because

              it follows that the Son and the Holy Spirit have the power of producing the Son.
              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              since the Father has this power

              The first conclusion:

              nevertheless the divine supposites are equal in the highest degree

              First corollary: 
              though the same thing

              This is clear through the conclusion. 
              It is confirmed because 
              where there is greater perfection, 
              equality and likeness 
              are truer and more proper. 
              But among the divine supposites 
              there is equality and likeness, 
              therefore it is most proper and most true.

              From this it seems to follows 
              in the first place that the equality and likeness 
              are not said in the divine only privatively, 
              but really and positively

              contingent or to conserve it in being.
              The first is clear because only the Father in the divine 
              produces the omnipotent Son necessarily, 
              as was clear above.

              The first part is clear because the power of generating the Son

            etc. 
            First conclusion of distinction 22: 
            that the many names which are said about are different. 
            For some are notional or signifying a property of the persons, <!-- why "designificantia" -->
            like generation, Father, Word, and similar things. 
            Some are essential, like virtue, wisdom, goodness, 
            which are said individually about each person. 
            Some are said translatively or through a likeness, 
            like mirror, splendor, character. 
            Some are said from time in relation to creatures 
            of which some are said of all persons, 
            like lord, creator, etc, 
            and some not about all persons, 
            like gift. 
            Some are some from time, 
            but not relatively to a creature, 
            like incarnate, humane 
            though they include a relation to creature 
            according to reality. <!-- translation of "secundum rem" is difficult -->
            Another is the name 
            which is said about all at the same time 
            and not of any individually, 
            like the Trinity.

            The second conclusion: 
            that names which properly pertain to individual persons, 
            like Father and Son and Holy Spirit, 
            are said relatively to one another,
            not substantially.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q21-d1e4257">
            Third conclusion: 
            that those names 
            which signify the unity of essence 
            are said absolutely and substantially 
            and about all persons individually 
            and about all persons joined together 
            in a singular number not as a plurality, 
            like good, great. 
            For we do not say three goods or three gods, 
            but one when taking the term substantively, 
            but when taking it adjectively 
            they are able to be called three great things.

            are not imposed substantially but relatively.
