            with respect to the infallible certitude of each of them,
            in this distinction 41 
            he begins to treat these topics 
            with respect to their causal ratio.

            is held from a human operation,

            incidentally whether the knowledge of God 
            is altered from a change in creatures.

              This is true 
              because someone is able to merit for another the first grace, 
              therefore by the same reason they can merit the final and ultimate grace, 
              but this seems to be the causal ratio of predestination, 
              therefore.
              The antecedent is clear 
              from the one currently praying for <name ref="#Paul">Paulo</name>. <!-- dbcheck "currently for stante; also is this paul the Apostle paul" -->
              This is confirmed, 
              for if no cause is given, 
              then it follows 
              that is the acceptor of persons 
              which is against scripture.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3625">
              In the second place, 
              there is condemnation of someone 
              and it is not from oneself,  
              therefore it is from some cause, 
              and it is not from God, 
              therefore.
              That it is not from God 
              is proved 
              because either it would be while God is willing it, 
              as <name ref="#Rimini">Gregory</name> says,
              and this is not the case because then the opposite would be impossible.
              Or while he is not willing 
              because then God wishes the evil of guilt, 
              or more precisely he wills this by not willing, 
              as
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q33-Rd1e284">

              </cit> 
              says, 
              and this is not because then 
              the future condemnation would not differ 
              from a merely possible future. 
              This is confirmed
              because God acts rationally 
              when condemning, 
              therefore this should be assigned 
              as the cause of condemnation and not God, 
              therefore the cause should be some temporal demerit or man, 
              and thus the proposed is had.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3646">
              In the third place principally, 
              God condemns the foreknown and predestines the predestined 
              on account of something which is not eternal to them 
              and is therefore temporal. 
              The consequence is clear, 
              and the antecedent is proved
              because there is some causa ratio in common or in general, 
              namely so that the generosity of divine mercy and the equity of justice may shine forth,
              as is said by

              Then in the second place 
              because it is granted that there is 
              a sine qua non of condemnation and predestination,
              as is said

            </head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3707">
              First conclusion: 
              though not every grade of charity or grace 
              is an effect of predestination,
              nevertheless divine predestination 
              is the cause of every meritorious act.
              Note nevertheless here I call 
              a <mentioned>meritorious act</mentioned> 
              as that for which some grade of glory will be given in heaven.
              The first part is 
              proved because someone predestined 
              is able to have grace or has it de facto, 
              but such grace is not de facto 
              causally or effectively from his destination, 
              since he was condemned, 
              therefore this part is true.
              The consequence is valid, 
              and the antecedent is clear from 
              <name>Judas</name> and many other foreknown people 
              who at sometime were and are in charity.
              The second part is proved because
              whatever is a cause of some end 
              is the cause of those things 
              which are necessarily required for this end. 
              But predestination is the cause of salvation, 
              therefore predestination will be 
              the cause of the merit necessarily required for salvation, 
              therefore the conclusion is completely true.
              This is confirmed in the saying of Christ

              Second conclusion: 
              just as the causal ratio of divine predestination 
              is divine offer to the predestined of final merit, <!-- loose translation; dbcheck -->
              so the non offer for final just existence and good acceptance 
              is causal with respect to condemnation. <!-- again loose tranlsation; dbcheck -->
              The conclusion is proved through
              <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>
              on the apostle, of whom when he wishes he is pitied <!-- translation help needed here -->

              but only for which the better man does not pay. <!-- translation help needed -->
              From such things the conclusion is clear.
              The argument is confirmed 
              since it does not belong to the one working 
              nor to the one willing

              The first corollary: 
              just as condemnation  
              through the proposed of not offering mercy <!-- translation help needed -->
              or not wishing for mercy 
              is not well expressed 
              so is insufficiently described <!-- translation "so" for "sed" -->
              through not offering alone 
              or through not willing mercy. <!-- translation help -->
              The first part is proved 
              because so offered 
              because they are disposed to wishing positively 
              but God with respect to condemnation is not disposed positively, 
              therefore.
              The second part is proved 
              because through 
              alone not proposed <!-- "solum non propositum" as some kind of technical phrase ?? -->
              the condemned or condemnation 
              is not distinguished from
              a merely possible future, 
              therefore through this
              condemnation is insufficiently described.
              The consequence holds, 
              and the antecedent is proved
              because the ratio of a positive future 
              that distinguishes it from a merely possible future 
              is the determination of the divine will.
              Again, 
              God does not have the proposition 
              or there is a non wishing in relation to a chimera

              The first is clear 
              because a distinctive or elective ratio 
              corresponds precisely to the determination of the divine will.
              The second part is clear

              unless the divine will.
              This is clear because, 
              if there were some etc, <!-- some predestination??? -->

            And is not so in the case of condemnation,
            by which he foreknew from eternity 
            those people who would be evil in the future and be damned, 
            that there is no merit for stubbornness, 
            indeed there is able to be some merit 
            because some earn demerit through their sins 
            such that grace is not appointed to them.

            Second conclusion: 
            that the catholic faith 
            rejects the idea 
            that souls already lived in heaven, 
            and that there they did some good and some bad things,
            and for these merits 
            they are cast down to the earth.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3987">
            Third conclusion: 
            that God choice 
            those from whom he wished 
            gracious mercy 
            not because they were future faithfuls
            but so that they would be faithful
            he gave grace to them, 
            not because they were faithful, 
            but so that they would become faithful, 
            but  nevertheless 
            it is not conceded 
            that he condemned some 
            so that the would be bad, 
            nor that he hardens some
            so that they would sin,
            because condemnation is not in this way 
            the cause of evil, 
            in the way that predestination is the cause of good.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3993">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that foreknew many things 
            which now he does not foreknow 
            because to foreknow 
            only applies to future things, 
            but there are many things 
            which were previously future
            that are now not 
            but rather are past or present.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q33-d1e3997">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that which God knew one time 
            he always knows, 
            just as when at sometime 
            he know that Christ would be born, 
            so now he knows 
            that was born with the same knowledge, 
            and therefore times and words 
            are things that change, 
            but faith and science are not, 
            etc.
