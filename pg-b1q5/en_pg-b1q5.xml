            This is the fourth distinction, which continues the preceding 
            because, after the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> determined about the unity of the essence 
            and the trinity of persons, then in this part he determines about their origin and their difference. 
            And it is divided into four parts according to which the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> does four things.
            In the first place he introduces the question, 
            in the second place he argues through reason, 
            in the third place responds to a doubt, 
            and in the fourth place he puts the solution of the argument. 
            The second begins at

              That not because God did not generate God, therefore. 
              The consequence is clear, 
              and the antecedent is proved because God did not generate another God different from himself, 
              therefore he did not generate God.
              The consequence holds because <unclear>nothing</unclear> <!-- ms seems to have "nihil" but the sense is unclear --> is able to generate itself nor another 
              because then there would be many gods, therefore etc.

              In the second place, if he generated a God different than himself, it follows that 
              there would be some reason signaling why one would generate another distinct from itself rather than the other.
              The consequent is false because there is no such 
              reason discoverable of giveable for one that does not equally apply to the other, 
              even in the case of an infinity of things.

              In the third place, the Son in the divine began to be, therefore hew was not before etc.
              The consequence holds and the antecedent is proved because 
              the Son is in some instant and was never before that instant, 
              therefore in this instant he began to be. This is confirmed because the Son 
              began to be in some instant because, if did not begin to be etc., 
              it follows that he did not begin to be in this instant, which is false.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e391">
              First conclusion: though <name ref="#Mary">the Virgin Maria</name> 
              conceived the same son temporally 
              which God the Father generated eternally, 
              nevertheless the <name ref="#Mary">Virgin Mother</name> conceived something 
              that God the Father did not generate.
              The first is clear because the son of God the Father and of the 
              <name ref="#Mary">Virgin Mary</name> is the same thing. 
              The second is clear because the <name ref="#Mary">Virgin</name> conceived the body of Christ 
              and God the Father did not generate this.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e403">
              The first corollary: though Christ was eternally, nevertheless he temporally 
              <pb ed="#L" n="24-v"/> 
              began to be Christ.
              The first part is clear because the Son was eternally. 
              The second part is clear because he began to be man temporally,
              therefore he temporally began to be Christ. 
              The consequence holds because, just as the rational soul
              and the body are one man, so God and man are one Christ.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e414">
              The second corollary: though there was some man eternally, 
              nevertheless whatever is a man came to be a man temporally.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e420">
              Third corollary: 
              it does not follow, this, i.e. Christ, was eternally, 
              therefore he did not begin to be man temporally. 
              This is clear from the same means <!-- need better translatin for "medio" --> 
              because the humanity of Christ began to be temporally.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e430">
              Another corollary: though Christ is necessarily as much the Son, as he is God, 
              nevertheless Christ is contingently the son of someone. 
              The first is clear because as the Father is necessarily the Father, so
              the Son is necessarily the Son and both are God. 
              The second is clear because he is contingently the son of the <name ref="#Mary">Virgin</name>.

            <head xml:id="pg-b1q5-Hd1e3884">Secunda conclusio</head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e438">
              Second conclusion: though with respect to us 
              it is not evidently probable that ther eare not many sons in the divine, 
              nevertheless it is necessary that God the Father begets a single Son 
              coeternal and consubstantial with himself.
              The first is clear because every means
              evident to us for inferring that <mentioned>the father generates one son</mentioned> is able to 
              infer equally <mentioned>the Son produces another Son</mentioned> 
              because all three persons are of the same perfection, 
              omnipotence, and activity. 
              The second is clear in the present distinction.
              Again, it is clear through 
              <ref><name ref="#Augustine">Augusine</name> in book VI <title ref="#deTrinitate">De Trinitate</title>, in the secon chapter</ref>, 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q5-Qd1e3906">the Son is God from God but not except through generation</quote>
                <bibl>Augustinus, De Trinitate VI, 2 (PL ??)</bibl>
              </cit>, 
              therefore etc. 
              This is confirmed because de facto God 
              the Father produced or beget only one Son equal to himself in every respect, 
              therefore it necessary that this is so. 
              The consequence is clear from what has been said above. 
              The antecedent is a catholic truth.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-pcqgpc">
              The first corollary: that it is not able to be demonstrated to us in this life 
              that there is one Son any more than it is an infinity are generated.
              The conclusion is clear.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e472">
              Second corollary: it is not evidently probable 
              that there are productions of diverse types in the divine.
              This is clear because by faith alone it is held that there are only two, 
              namely generation and spiration.
            </p> 
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-tcsado">
              Third corollary: just as there are many necessary things 
              which are not demonstrably necessarily evident, 
              so many things are impossible 
              which even imply a contradiction to which no one is able to be led 
              through natural reason alone.
              The first part is clear from the articles of faith that are signifying the Trinity. 
              The second is clear because the statement that <mentioned>Father does not generate the Son </mentioned> 
              includes a hidden contradiction which no one in the natural light
              is able to illuminate or show demonstratively to another.
            </p>

          <div xml:id="pg-b1q5-Dd1e3944">
            <head xml:id="pg-b1q5-Hd1e3946">Third conclusion</head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q5-d1e501">
              Third conclusion: thought God the Father eternally generated 
              God the Son, it is nevertheless not properly said that after his generation 
              he produced something temporally.
              The first is clear through what has been said 
              and it is able to be confirmed through  
              <ref><title ref="#ps">Psalm</title> 2</ref> 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q5-Qd1e3965" source="http://scta.info/resource/ps2_7">Dominus dixit ad me

                <bibl>Psalmus 2:7</bibl>
              </cit>. 
              The second is proved because any divine act internal to itself 
              is measured in an instant of eternity, therefore terms conveying a lapse 
              or difference of time are no properly said about the divine.
              The consequence holds because <mentioned>after</mentioned>, 
              <mentioned>before</mentioned>, <mentioned>when</mentioned>, 
              and similar terms deal with differences of time. 
              The antecedent is clear through 
              <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name> in <ref><title ref="#ps">Psalm</title> 101</ref> 
              where he says:

              Therefore it is both prior and posterior. 
              The major premise is proved because in the divine essence there is an order of essential reasons

              just as it is clear in the proposed about generation and motion.

              and in such a case the genus is said about God but the species is not, 
              just as the universal whole is said about God

              Again he solves the same through the same and thus does not return an argument, 
              since memory, intelligence, and cognition are in the Son just as in the Father. 
              Therefore I say otherwise that no argument is known to us for why the Father generated this Son and not another, 
              an argument in which the antecedent is known to us from the consequent can be inferred because, 
              given any such reason,

            is, if there had been time before the age was in these things or while 
            these things were because, though God co-exists with each part of time, 
            nevertheless properly God is not in time, but in eternity or in an instant of eternity. 
            Thus in the same way the author authorities are able to be solved. 
            From what has been said it is clear that it does not follow: God is not prior because it was not, 
            therefore he begins or began to be.
