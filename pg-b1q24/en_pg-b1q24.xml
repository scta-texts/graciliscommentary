            This is distinction 28

            therefore in the first place he treats the first,

              since any of these supposites

              First corollary: 
              though the Father is said 
              to be everything which is 
              and which has to communicate with the Word, 
              nevertheless the Father is able 
              to reveal nothing to the Son or the Word itself. 
              The first is clear through

              The second is clear 
              because to reveal 
              conveys imperfection 
              because it argues that there is a non-knowing 
              in the one who a revelation is made, 
              therefore it ought not to be attributed to the divine Word, 
              since it is the true art and declarative knowledge of the truth.

              Second conclusion: 
              the divine Word is a singular term of paternal intellection, 
              emanating from the one understanding 
              by an act that remains internal and of another and declarative of itself.
              This conclusion is clear 
              because, 
              if it were not singular, 
              it follows in the first place that paternal understanding would not have understood itself,
              which is false. 
              In the second place, 
              it follows that such a term would not have been produced from the full fecundity of understanding 
              and from every intrinsic perfection, 
              which is false. 
              In the third place,

              and this beginning is said to be

              a beginning is admitted within the divine, 
              and the name with respect to the same thing is excluded. 
              The first part is clear 
              because the Son truly and really

              nevertheless he is able to begin something. 
              The first part is clear

              is producible by the three divine supposites.

            The first conclusion of distinction 28: 
            that <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> 
            is said relatively about thee Father 
            and <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> is said 
            according to the property of the generation 
            and it is said relatively 
            because it is not said according to the substance, 
            for what is said relatively does not indicate substance.
            Therefore, though <mentioned>begotten</mentioned> and <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> 
            are diverse, nevertheless they do not indicate a diverse substance.

            Second conclusion:

            though properly it is not called <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> 
            because <mentioned>unbegotten</mentioned> is said according to the notion

            that the Father is called the beginning
