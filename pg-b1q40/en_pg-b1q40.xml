            This is distinction 48 
            and the last of book 1 
            in which, 
            after the <name xml:id="pg-b1q40-Nd1e120" ref="#Lombard">Master</name>
            showed in the preceding distinction 
            the efficacy of the divine will, 
            here he shows the 
            concordance or consonance 
            of the created will to the divine will <!-- double check "divine will" "will is sort of supplied -->
            And it is divided into two parts, 
            for in the first place 
            he shows 
            that conformity in the thing willed 
            is not evidence of 
            the good will of the person, 
            in the second place
            he shows 
            that the good will of God 
            is sometimes fulfilled 
            through the depraved will of a human being
            or a will deformed by sin.

              <pb ed="#L" n="123-r"/>
              The consequence is clear 
              for a similar reason 
              namely because 
              the divine intellect is the rule 
              of anything true and correct, 
              otherwise 
              when the intellect assents to a false opinion
              it would not err,

              In the second place, 
              no act is correct

              therefore. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because 
              no act is just or correct 
              and accepted 
              unless it conforms to the divine will. 
              The antecedent is clear

              In the third place, 
              it is not the case 
              that the divine created will 
              has rectitude without its own likeness or conformity 
              to the divine will, 
              therefore. 
              The consequence is clear 
              since the correct act of the will 
              presupposes and includes rectitude. 
              And the antecedent is clear through 
              the saying of

              This is confirmed 
              because the divine will 
              is not conforming to the created, 
              therefore neither is the converse the case. 
              The consequence holds 
              because 
              relative comparisons 
              are said to be 
              converses.

              would truly and certainly know somethning 
              and God would not know it.
              The consequent is impossible
              since the divine intellect is 
              the idea and cognitive and representative exemplar 
              of anything which is true. 
              And the consequence is clear
              because,
              if the divine and human intellect 
              understand the same object 
              under the same formal ratio, 
              then it follows 
              that there is conformity in the object known.

              The first part is clear 
              because moral rectitude exceeds natural rectitude. 
              Against,

              and at the same time 
              the they are in conformity with one and the same thing.
              This is clear 
              because the angel of the Persians
              was wishing to resist the angel of Daniel 
              working for the liberation of the Israelite people in 12 days

              the angel prohibited it,

              because they were willing 
              that which God was willing for them to will
              otherwise they would have been sinning,

              First corollary: 
              though the pilgrim will that acts in deformity with right reason 
              is itself sinning and demeritorious, 
              nevertheless the will 
              that a will that acts in conformity to right reason
              does not always imply that this will itself is just or meritorious.
              The first part 
              is clear when speaking about adult pilgrims 
              both because 
              someone who acts against conscience or the dictate of reason
              helps build Gehenna 
              and because

              therefore not just any conformity of the will to right reason 
              implies that the will is just. 
              Again, 
              someone is able to wish to give alms

              it follows a fortior 
              that someone existing in pure nature

              This is clear 
              because according to all doctors
              anyone ought to will 
              what God wishes 
              them to will, 
              but there is a possible case 
              where God wishes 
              that someone will the opposite 
              of that which God wills, 
              therefore. 
              From these things 
              the affirmative response to the question is clear.

              it is argued thus,
              the human and divine intellect 
              are infinitely distant and dissimilar, 
              therefore between them 
              there is no conformity, 
              and consequently 
              the conclusion is false. 
              The first consequence is clear 
              because between infinitely dissimilar things 
              no conformity seems to be possible.
              And the second consequence is clear

              I say that conformity is two-fold, 
              one is natural or a proportion of natural co-measure, 
              the other is a kind of disposition and imitation.
              When speaking about the first 
              the antecedent is conceded, 
              but the consequence is denied.

              The objection is clear from

              In the second place, 
              it would be able to be said
              when denying the antecedent 
              because 
              just as the reasoning is more suitable to an angel, 
              so etc.
              To the confirmation 
              which is second, <!-- transl check --> 
              it is said that 
              <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q40-Qd1e940">
                  one straight line 
                  is not more straight than another
                </quote>
              </cit>, 
              therefore. 
              Here it is said that, 
              just as a straight line of gold is different 
              than a straight line of iron, 
              so it is in the proposed. 
              But it would be able to objected 
              because this does not solve the argument
              because, 
              though in this case 
              there is not an equally good rectitude, 
              nevertheless there is in this case 
              an equal rectitude 
              in the being of rectitude. 
              To this it is said 
              that there is not a similarity between the case of straight lines 
              and the right dictates
              because the fact that a line to be straight 
              does not come from something extrinsic  
              to which more and more is able to be in conformity, 
              as is the case of a correct dictate, 
              therefore the cases are not the same, 
              and therefore the consequences should be denied. 
              Again, 
              it is noted that, 
              just as an indivisible ternary 
              is not a ternary and similarly a binary, 
              nevertheless the ternary exceeds a binary, 
              <pb ed="#L" n="116-r"/>
              so a rectitude consists in something indivisible, 
              and yet nevertheless one exceeds the other 
              and one rectitude is a perfection.

                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q40-Qd1e969">
                  because then it would be the case that

              etc., 
              this consequence is denied,

              wills however he himself wills. 
              The reason is because 
              with respect to his own deformed will 
              God has no will.

              To the proof, 
              it is said that 
              it is not the same for
              Christ to be killed 
              and Christ to be injustly killed.
              Again, 
              it is said that 
              I am able to will that Christ was obedient to the Father 
              and posited those things <!-- "translation" review for posited -->
              those things which are meritorious for our salvation, 
              and nevertheless I ought not to will 
              that the Jews killed Christ.
              Therefore, 
              though it was not possible that Christ be killed 
              except unjustly, 
              nevertheless 
              <unclear>of the pure one and saints</unclear><!-- this seems wrong but I can't decipher at the moment-->
              I am able to will his passion and that of other saints,

              And thus in the killing of Christ 
              there are distinct objects, 
              namely the good of virtue in Christ 
              and the evil of the will in the Jews.

              objects 
              because, 
              if he was not able to be killed except unjustly, 
              it follows that man is not able to be redeemed 
              unless someone committed a new sin.
              Here the consequence is denied, 
              though man was not able to be redeemed 
              through the death of Christ 
              unless someone unjustly killed Christ, 
              nevertheless he was able to redeem man 
              in a other way than through his death, 
              but this material pertains to the third book.

            For with a good will
            they wish the passion of Christ 
            who they suffering with 
            and from compassion 
            they do not wish it. 
            But whoever was wishing this 
            so that his crown would be increased 
            was wishing this, etc.
