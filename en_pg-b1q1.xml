            The first part is able to be divided into three parts
            according to which the <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> puts three causes 
            <unclear>drawing him away</unclear> from the compilation of this work.
            The first is the subtlety of this science. 
            The second is the difficulty of this material. 
            The third is the sting of envy.
            In the second part he puts three causes urging 
            and inducing him to the compilation of this book.
            The first is the example of the poor widow. 
            The second is the hope of an eternal reward. 
            The third are the constant request of his companions.
            In the third part he compares the aforesaid causes to one another 
            by showing the victory of the motivating causes.

            And this last cause is divided into three. For in the first part, 
            the evidence of the contradiction of the enemies is stated.
            In the second, the reason for the contradiction is stated.

            This is the division of the prologue in general.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q1-isvioa">
            More specifically, the <name>Lombard</name> truly proceeds thus because first he puts one cause 
            moving him to the compilation of this book which is the desire of completing it 
            and immediately he adds the cause drawing him away from it,
            which is the lack of talent and knowledge.
            After these things, he identifies a cause drawing him away which is the loftiness of the subject matter
            and the magnitude of the labor, 
            and immediately he includes the contrary moving cause 
            which is the confidence of divine help and the prize promised by Christ. 
            After these things, he points out the victory of the moving causes by saying 
            that the intense love which he has for the church, which inflames him to undertake the book, 
            conquers the two things which seem to draw him away from the compilation of this.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q1-iapipv">
            In another part, he says that he turns his attention to three things. 
            First regarding the defense of the catholic faith, 
            second regarding the truth of theological explanation, 
            third regarding the manifestation of the sacraments.
            After these things, he puts another moving<!-- should be moventem in latin text --> 
            which is the love <!--conirm with john that this is caritas --> and presence <!-- should be instantia not instantiam in latin text --> 
            of brothers and colleagues, and <!-- should be "et" not "est" --> immediately he adds a third contrary cause drawing him away which 
            is the sting and contradiction of critics <!-- i like critics for invidorum -->. 
            After this he puts the cause of contradiction which is 
            the discord and disorderedness of the will from which error comes and from error hate <!-- hate for invidia rather than "envy", change earlier instances -->
            and from hate arises contradiction. After this he points out the wickedness of the ones contradicting since, namely, 
            they do not subject the will to reason and they do not follow the right reason 
            nor do they wish to submit themselves to the authority of sacred scripture. 
            Rather to both reason and the authority of scripture they propose their own sense <!-- should be sensum not secundum in latin text-->
            and by some <!-- should be quadam not quamdam in latin--> superstitious religion externally simulated they have an argument 
            for showing a new wisdom, 
            by devising some <!-- should remain quamdam --> doctrine and by some <!-- should be quadam not quamdam in latin -->loud intention fighting stubbornly against the truth.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q1-pacmtq">
            After this he assigns the causes of the work. In the first place 
            he touches the final cause which is twofold, 
            namely the turning of the church from falsity or evil things and the manifestation of catholic truth.
            After this he puts the efficient cause which is twofold, 
            namely the principle cause which is God and the instrumental cause 
            which is the <name ref="#Lombard">Magister</name> himself.
            After he puts the material cause, 
            namely the testimony of truth of the canons and saints. 
            After this, he touches the formal cause which is twofold, 
            namely the form of the treatise which consists in 
            a division of the work through books and chapters; 
            the other is the form of treating, which is the same as the mode of acting.
            After this he says that at the same in these books he puts forward chapters for an easier and lighter entrance or introduction.
            And thus the sentences of this prologue end here, 
            about which the following question is asked.

              The consequence holds since this is a theological truth.
              The antecedent is true because just as the pursuit of a stone is to find a final place of rest,

              First conclusion: though theological assent is not distinct from a theological proposition, 
              nevertheless it is true that two propositions are formed of the same subject or predicate signifying the same thing 
              and are distinguished one from the other specifically.
              The first part is clear because, if they were distinguished, it would follow 
              that theological assent would be able to be without a theological proposition.
              The consequent is false because then someone would be able to assent 
              without complex knowledge which is contrary to the truth.
              The second part is proved because, if it were supposed that a believing person 
              formed the following proposition <mentioned>Christ has died</mentioned>
              and an unbelieving person formed the same proposition with respect to the terms, then 
              the faithful person assents to what is signified by this proposition 
              <unclear>when forming it</unclear>, and the unfaithful person does not assent,
              therefore they are specifically distinct. The consequence is clear because one is really and intrinsically 
              assent and the other is not, and nevertheless they have the same subject and predicate. 
              Therefore the conclusion is true. 
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-pcqnet">
              The first corollary: it is true that a person could know the entire holy scriptures 
              and not be a theologian. This is clear because if an unbelieving person knew 
              the scriptures, he would not be a theologian because he would not assent.
              This is confirmed because if the believing pilgrim knew and formed every proposition to which the unbeliever assented,
              he would despite this still be an infidel because he would consent to them. There for similar reason,
              the one know the Holy Scriptures and dissenting is not a theology.
              For this reason it should be known that infidelity is an assent with respect to what is false 
              or dissent with respect to what is determined to be true by the Church or revealed in Holy Scripture.

              The second corollary: it is true that the pilgrim could be informed with the theological 
              habit yet not be considered a theologian. From this is able to further inferred and conceded 
              that from the ordained law 
              <pb ed="#L" n="13-r"/> 
              the theologian is able to remain in faith, but is not always able t
              to remain or be a theologian without faith. From this it further follows that the <mentioned>theological</mentioned>

              The third corollary: one indistinct proposition is able to have two contradictories 
              distinct in species. This is clear because the contradictory of a proposition is able to be 
              the immediate assent of one and the immediate dissent of another.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q1-scqsot">
              The second conclusion: though a theological proposition is theological cognition,
              nevertheless it is not necessarily knowledge by which someone is said to know 
              the total object of its own being. <!--  meaning is not entirely clear --> 
              The first part is proved because faith or theological knowledge do not differ from theological assent, 
              but theological assent is a theological proposition, therefore a theological proposition is theological knowledge or cognition.
              The major premise is clear because theological faith <!-- theological faith is a strange phrase, but "fides theologica" does appear to be a phrase mostly appearing in later 16th authors --> 
              is not able to be without theological assent, otherwise
              someone would believe something and not assent to it, which is false. 
              The minor is clear from the first conclusion. The second part is proved because 
              nothing is caused by itself, but our knowledge is at least partially caused by an object, 
              therefore this knowledge is not its own total object. <!--unsure about own total object -->

              <!-- this paragraph might be better added to above paragraph -->
              This is confirmed because, suppose there was a vision that was a vision of itself, 
              it would still be required some object by which ti is caused. 
              Thus having supposed that the same thing is knowledge of itself, 
              nevertheless another object is required by which such knowledge is caused, and, as a consequence, 
              it is not its total object, which was the conclusion to be proved.

              Second corollary: theology or another science is not properly speaking known, 
              but is that by which something is known or cognized. This is clear through the fact that that which is known 
              is the object of the science, but science is not the object of itself, at least not the the total object, therefore.

              This is clear from the fundamental point since science is not properly known but is that by which something is known to be in this way or not.

              The third conclusion, though it is not impossible for the pilgrim to not believe any theological truths 
              and still have the act and habit of faith, nevertheless under the present law it is impossible that 
              the pilgrim assent to theological truths without any special light.
              The first part is proved in the first place regarding the habit. There is no doubt that 
              many have the habit of the virtues without that habit being put into act. <!-- this is similar to a brief discussion had by Holcot in question 1-->
              But that the act of faith is able to be without believing is proved because  the act of faith 
              and the actuation or the doing itself are not more identical than an accident and its adherence. 
              But God is able to make an accident without adherence, therefore.

              The first corollary: many are saved in the end who have never believed or never actually believe.

              Greeks dying immediately <pb n="13-v" ed="#L"/> after baptism before the age of discretion.
              For it happens that the Greeks are baptized, though it is through a different form of words,

              This is clear because it is possible that someone can licitly believe nothing for a certain amount of time, 
              therefore it is possible that such a person does not err nor believe just as the Roman Church believes.

              The consequence is valid. The antecedent is proved because every proposition which

              In the second place it follows that if a theologian were to become an infidel or heretic, 
              then he would lose the entirety of the theological science. The consequence is clear 
              because he would lose the assent to the theological propositions and such assent is 
              the theological science. But the falsity of this is proved since such a person would still know how to
              defend our faith,to read and dispute, and to solve arguments just as before, 
              since he does not know less than before.

              In the third place, we assent to a proposition through assent,

              The consequence is clear because we do not assent to a proposition 
              by means of a proposition since, if this were the case, the same thing

              The antecedent is proved because a person is able to believe some proposition 
              to be true and later not believe, but rather believe the opposite on account

              In the fifth place against the second part

              if someone were to form the following proposition <mentioned>no man is an ass</mentioned>, 
              then it would follows that no one dissenting to this would be able to form a proposition of the 
              same type (species). The consequence is clear from the terms. The falsity is proved 
              because the one dissenting to this proposition is able to form a proposition
              of the same subject and predicate, therefore it is of the same type (species).
              This consequence is clear since propositions are nothing other than their terms taken together.

              as a consequence is a theologian. If they are diverse, 
              then suppose that there is a remission of all things uniformly, equally, and precisely toward non-being, 
              then they either arrive equally at non-being or not.

              If the first, then the objection against the first corollary is sustained. The second option is not valid

              This is confirmed because by the same reasons some

              In another mode it is taken from a proposition which is intrinsically theological assent,

              is not able to be without theological assent. And for the proof, what the argument

              it is said that some degree of theology will remain, but it would not properly
