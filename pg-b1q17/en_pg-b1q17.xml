            This is the second principal part of distinction 17
            which thus continues the first part 
            because 
            after the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name>
            posited his intention about the love of God and neighbor, 
            now he shows how it [charity] receives 
            increase or intention within us.
            And this part 
            is divided into three 
            because 
            in the first place the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            regarding this introduces the critical question, 
            in the second place hi posits the proper response, 
            and in the third place he adds a different confirmation.
            The second begins at

            Whether through 
            the greater virtual perfection of moral goodness 
            in the pilgrim 
            we are able to conclude that there is a gradual intension 
            of created charity in that same pilgrim?

              That not 
              because any doing well of a just pilgrim 
              is to act well immeasurably with respect 
              to the species of moral goodness and virtue, 
              therefore no such thing is intended,
              and as a consequence 
              neither is charity.
              The consequence is clear 
              because to the unmeasured 
              something greater is not able to be given.
              The antecedent is proved 
              because to do something meritorious 
              proceeds from the formal power of the Holy Spirit, 
              consequently such an act is an immeasurable good 
              with respect to the species of moral virtue and moral goodness. 
              This is the argument of
              <cit>

              In the second place, 
              if charity were able to be intended gradually, 
              it would follow that 
              that would also be able to remitted gradually. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because just as through the replication of degrees there becomes a gradual intension, 
              so through the remission or the cessation of those degrees 
              there is a remission of them. 
              But the falsity of the consequent 
              is proved 
              because this remission occurs 
              either through a mortal or a venial sin. 
              Not the latter 
              because this corrupts the entire charity, 
              and not the second 
              because then the venial sin 
              would punish with an eternal penalty by its own proper ratio, 
              which is against the

              In the third place, 
              if charity 
              were intended gradually, 
              then either acquired charity 
              would be the same with the first or different. 
              If the latter, 
              then it follows that 
              the same thing increases and produces itself. 
              If the second, 
              it follows that two habits 
              distinct only in number 
              would be in the same soul, 
              and thus there would be 
              as many loves in man 
              as a man has degrees of love, 
              which does not seem like it should be said. 
              This is confirmed 
              because either this degree would 
              essential to the quality of charity preexisting in goodness <!-- needs transcription and translation review here --> 
              or it would be accidental.
              If the first, 
              then this first form would be prior to the species of the other
              because charity is in some essential part. 
              If the second, 
              it follows 
              that it does not make one thing in itself 
              with the charity preceding it, 
              and thus it does not increase it.

              In opposition, 
              it is argued that 
              the moral goodness of any pilgrim 
              proves according to the common law 
              some degree of charity in the same thing, 
              therefore the greater goodness would prove greater charity.
              But now some pilgrim is 
              more perfect and morally better than before, 
              therefore someone now has more 
              charity than before, 
              and this cannot be unless through the gradual intention of charity, 
              therefore the question is true.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e239">
              First conclusion: 
              though the Holy Spirit is not able 
              to form and actuate the created mind immeasurably, 
              nevertheless the Holy 
              <pb ed="#L" n="55-v"/>
              Spirit is the activating formal power and salvation of the just mind.
              The first part is clear 
              because it is repugnant for the finite and measured 
              to be actuated and formed immeasurably 
              in its own acting.
              The second part is proved through 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e274">

                  we are formed and created by God

              And these words are used in this distinction 
              where it is said that 
              without the Holy Spirit 
              we are not able to love Christ 
              and we are not able to keep his commandments 
              and the less we perceive it 
              to the same degree that power is not able to reach us.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e277">
              First corollary: 
              the formal actuative power of the Holy Spirit is as intensely in the mind 
              as it intrinsically gives pleasing or charitable being to it.
              The conclusion and corollary 
              are against  
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e310">

              where he asks whether 
              naturally good things are able to be 
              rationally proportioned or compared 
              to gratuitiously good things.
              The corollary is clear 
              because according to 
              <ref xml:id="pg-b1q17-Rd1e322">
                <name ref="#Augustine">Augustine</name>

              </ref> 
              the less we perceive the Holy Spirit in us 
              the less we are able to love Christ, 
              and the more we perceive it the 
              more we love, 
              therefore

              The second corollary: 
              any action proceeding 
              from the formal power of 
              uncreated charity 
              is a finite act with respect to the degree 
              and species of virtue and moral goodness. 
              This is clear because 
              then the Holy Spirit would not be 
              power in the mind according to greater and lesser degrees,

              Third corollary:

              from the formal power of uncreated charity 
              with respect species in the being of the mind 
              is infinitely meritorious or attributable to the will. 
              This is clear because otherwise 
              all meritorious works would be of the same species, 
              which is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because all things proceed

              The second conclusion: 
              though no grade of charity 
              is removed from some evil or guilt, 
              nevertheless any created charity 
              is an intensibile and remissible form.
              The first part is proved because 
              guilt does not diminish charity 
              according to the second introduced against the opposition.
              The second part is proved 
              because any created charity 
              is divisible in degrees,
              therefore it is intensible and remissible 
              through some power.
              The antecedent is clear 
              because neither a maximum nor minimum 
              degree of charity should be given.
              And the consequence is clear 
              since God is able at once and successively 
              to produce or corrupt 
              any form having and intensive latitude.
              But to us it does not matter whether 
              God produces it in the soul 
              at once or successively,

              The corollary is proved 
              because just as 
              intension is in a corporeal quality, 
              so fervor is in charity.
              But the intension of a quality 
              is not distinguished from the quality, 
              though through a comparison of the extremes 
              it is in some way varied, 
              therefore neither is the fervor 
              of charity distinguished from charity itself. 
              But according to the conclusion 
              no degree of charity is diminished through a venial sin, 
              therefore neither is the fervor diminished.

              The corollary is proved 
              because venial guilt is compossible with charity 
              and does not reduce charity,

              Third conclusion: without the intension or 
              remission of created charity
              <pb ed="#L" n="56-r"/>
              it stands that the pilgrim is better and more perfect 
              than moral perfection, 
              otherwise the conclusion would be posited 
              that without a new grade or the 
              abjection in the mind of the pilgrim 
              it stands that charity would be intended 
              and the pilgrim would be better now than before.
              The conclusion is proved 
              because the Holy Spirit 
              with any charity is able to incline the mind 
              equally to inhering in God with love more firmly 
              and for doing well meritoriously, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because it is just as easy 
              for the Holy Spirit to concur and to produce 
              with a weak and diminished second cause 
              as it is with an intensified and great second cause. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because that the mind loves God fervently 
              is improve the pilgrim and for charity to be intensified.
              This conclusion

              the essence of love with respect to its essentila grade 
              does not change.
              Nevertheless I do not wish to say that
              the intension of charity thus occurs de facto
              but from the possible.

              The first corollary: 
              with respect to the remission of cupidity 
              the intension of created charity should not be quantified.
              This is clear from the conclusion,

              This is confirmed 
              because the charity of the glorious virgin 
              would not have been intensified, 
              which is absolutely false. 
              The consequence is clear

              Third responsive corollary: 
              though de facto greater moral perfection 
              implies a greater charity in the mind 
              or in the will of a just pilgrim, 
              nevertheless without the gradual intension of charity 
              it is the case that the same thing is better 
              now than before from the actuation of immeasurable love 
              or of the highest creator. 
              This is clear because 
              the mind is able to be disposed  better

              be intimated to the mind more fervently

              of charity or grace.

              it advantages some to sin, 
              and nevertheless no one ought to desire to sin. 
              He points to the example of <name ref="#Peter">Peter</name>.
              Again, 
              it is not as bad to kill a man 
              and to repent as it is to commit a 
              venial sin and not make satisfaction, 
              and nevertheless the first 
              should not fled less than the second, 
              rather more so.

              To the first against the third conclusion,

              To the proof 
              it is said that God without motion 
              and without any production 
              is able to intend charity 
              however it is pleasing to him. 
              In the second place, 
              it is said that given that 
              charity would concur actively 
              for its own intension, 
              nevertheless it does not do so productively 
              because not every thing is production 
              because not every agent produces something. 
              In the third place, 
              it is said that 
              it would not be necessary 
              that such a course terminates 
              to some entity,

              it is said that the lessening of cupidity 
              is with respect to the intention of charity,

              it is said that the venom of charity,

              In the second place,

              not every cupidity 
              is the love of temporal things, 
              just as is clear from jealousy 
              and blasphemy and many other similar things. 
              To the authority of the 
              <name ref="#Aristotle">Philosopher</name>, 
              it is said that 
              he speaks about the temporal motion of bodily things, 
              therefore it is not relevant to what has been proposed about charity.

              To the two first arguments in the opposition

            <p xml:id="pgb1q17-d1e1101">
              To the third, 
              it is able to be said that these two charities made one thing 
              through the unity of aggregation, 
              just as two equal things make one through themselves.
              Again, 
              it is one through the unity of composition 
              and homogeneity, 
              therefore it does not follow that 
              there are two habits in the soul 
              differing in number only.
              To the confirmation, 
              it is said that the grade 
              after it has been acquired is essential to it 
              because such a grade 
              with the preceding makes and constitutes 
              one form in itself. 
              And when it is said, 
              <mentioned>therefore preexisting charity</mentioned>, 
              this consequence is denied 
              because nothing required by that species it its being 
              was lacking for it before 
              nor before this was essential to it 
              because it was not, etc.
              But on the contrary 
              because it follows that 
              this soul will be charitably pleasing in many ways at the same time, 
              namely have been intensed and remissed 
              and thus it will be intensely please 
              and remissly pleasing 
              which is clear because some form is able to denominate a subject,  
              and as a consequence intensed and remissed grade 
              denominated the intensed and remissed subject. 
              This is said by denying the consequence 
              because though intensed and remissed charity 
              are not contrary, 
              nevertheless because to be pleasing remissly 
              conveys the negation of intensed charity, 
              therefore at the same time it is not possible for the same thing 
              to be pleasing intensely and remissly. 
              And when it is said 
              because some form, etc., 
              it is conceded that it will denominate the subject, 
              thus this is pleasing in so much charity and so much etc, 
              but not by saying this is pleasing remissly.
