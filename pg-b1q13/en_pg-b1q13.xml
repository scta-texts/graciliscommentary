            This is distinction 14 which with respect to the preceding 
            continues in the following way. 
            For after the 
            <name ref="#Lombard">Master</name> 
            determined about the eternal emanation 
            of the Holy Spirit, 
            now he begins to treat about his temporal mission. 
            And this is divided into two parts 
            because first he shows that 
            the Holy Spirit is given specially to human beings 
            from the Father and the Son, 
            in the second place
            he asks 
            whether it is able to be given by holy human beings. 
            The second part begins at

            </cit>.
            The first 
            is divided into two parts 
            because in the first place he offers his 
            intention about the beginning of this temporal mission, 
            in the second place he refutes a false opinion drawn from what he has proposed. 
            The second begins at

            The second principal part is divided in three parts, 
            for in the first place 
            he shows that the Holy Spirit is not able to be given 
            by a mere creature, 
            in the second place 
            he shows how the authority of the 
            <name ref="#Paul">Apostle</name> seems contrary to this.
            In the third place he shows how 
            this should be explained.
            The second begins at

            Whether the temporal mission of the Holy Spirit 
            in the heart of the faithful is an eternal procession 
            not having a beginning? Whether the temporal donation the Holy Spirit 
            in the heart of the faithful is of the same eternal spiration 
            that comes from the Father and the Son?

            </head>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-qnqefe">
              That not 
              because the Holy Spirit 
              is not given nor sent 
              temporally to creatures, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              if this were true, 
              either such a giving 
              would require some prior disposition 
              in the receiving creature, 
              or some nature. 
              If the first, 
              it follows that it is a disposition of a disposition, 
              and thus there will be an infinite process in 
              such prerequisite dispositions
              or there will be some disposition 
              that can be given absolutely not presupposing a prior disposition, 
              and then it will be able to be said similarly about the giving 
              of the Holy Spirit 
              that it is will be a first 
              not requiring a prior.
              If the second, 
              it follows that
              one will be equally capable of receiving the Holy Spirit
              <pb ed="#L" n="45-v"/>
              whether indisposed or disposed, 
              which is false, 
              therefore. 
              In the second place, 
              the antecedent is proved 
              because, 
              if the Holy Spirit were given to a creature, 
              it would follows 
              that it would be united to itself as habitual charity, 
              which is false.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-d1e200">
              In the second place principally, 
              it is argued therefore 
              the Holy Spirit would be given 
              either with its own gift 
              or with nothing 
              or with something and not something.
              Not the first 
              then the Holy Spirit would coexist 
              with the gift of fear, 
              which is false 
              because charity 
              expels fear.
              Not the second 
              because then 
              contraries would be verified 
              about the same thing without change 
              or a new position of the thing 
              against the article. 
              Nor the third 
              because the argument is not greater 
              for one thing than for another, therefore.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-tpqtcs">
              In the third place principally, 
              it is as repugnant to be eternally given in time 
              as it is to be given or proceed temporally as eternal, 
              but the first is impossible, 
              therefore. 
              The antecedent is clear 
              because a person proceeding and everything temporal 
              is mutable, 
              as says
              <cit>
                <ref xml:id="pg-b1q13-Rd1e208">

              </cit> 
              And this is confirmed 
              because things which differ in reason alone 
              are really different. 
              But the temporal sending of the Holy Spirit 
              and the eternal procession are of this type, 
              therefore. 
              The minor is clear 
              because 
              when the procession of the Holy Spirit 
              terminates in an eternal object it is called eternal, 
              but when it terminates in a temporal object 
              it is called temporal.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-d1e249">
              First conclusion: 
              it is the case that 
              any incomplex gift of the Holy Spirit 
              formally inheres in the rational creature 
              and through this gift  
              the creature is not able to be gratified by God. 
              This is proved because 
              it is the case that any 
              created incomplex gift is able to be conserved 
              and to not be accepted as agreeable to himself 
              by the same one, therefore. <!-- translation REALLY unclear -->
              This is confirmed 
              because only God suffices 
              to justify and elevate the mind gratuitiously,
              therefore.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-d1e263">
              The first corollary: 
              though the Holy Spirit or the uncreated gift is only sufficient  
              for gratification, 
              nevertheless it does not inhere 
              in the mind 
              through the mode of a gift 
              or habitual grace. 
              The first part is clear 
              because the mind is 
              pleasing to God prior to <!-- using "prior" for "primo"; a bit of a stretch --> 
              the created charity given to it, 
              therefore.
              This is confirmed 
              because God 
              does not choose us from time, 
              but <cit>
                <quote xml:id="pg-b1q13-Qamcamc">before the constitution of the world</quote>

                <name ref="#Paul">Apostle</name>
              </ref>.
              The second part 
              is proven 
              because it is a kind of imperfection 
              to inhere in a manner other than through the mode of habit, 
              therefore from God this should be entirely denied.
            </p>
            <p xml:id="pgb1q13-scncse">
              The second corollary: 
              no incomplex created gift of the Holy Spirit 
              is formally and intrinsically repugnant to 
              or incompossible with damnation or guilt. 
              This is clear 
              because every thing that is repugnant 
              is intrinsically able to gratify and 
              and sufficient for the expulsion of guilt.

              Third corollary: 
              no created grace 
              nor some created gift 
              suffices through itself to remove guilt or mortal sin. 
              This is clear

              sin is compossible with 
              any such created gift, 
              such as created charity.

              The second conclusion: 
              though the Holy Spirit is the effective 
              causal ratio of all his gifts, 
              nevertheless it is not a necessary connexive ratio existing in them all at the same time.
              This is clear through

              The second part 
              is proved 
              because the Holy Spirit does not have a greater 
              nor a more necessary connection with respect to one 
              than with respect to all, 
              but it does not have a necessary connection

              The first corollary: 
              it stands that the Holy Spirit 
              descends to the rational mind 
              and does not communicate to it 
              any gratituous incomplexly created gift.
              This is clear because 
              between this there is no necessary 
              and absolute connection through communication. 
              This is confirmed because the 
              Holy Spirit communicates his gift most freely, 
              not only what he wills, 
              but even when he wills

              Second corollary: 
              it stands that the gift of the Holy Spirit 
              is diffused in the rational mind 
              and the person of the Holy Spirit 
              is not infused through this special descending 
              into the same mind. 
              This is clear 
              because gifts are distinct from it. 
              Again, 
              gifts do not have a necessary connection, 
              such that they necessarily exist in the same thing

              the Holy Spirit is able to be communicated

              The second part is proved

              through which 
              there is created in it a clean heart and 
              a just being.

              Third conclusion:

              nevertheless the sending or gratuitous diffusion of this type
              is improperly referred to as temporal.
              The first part 
              is proved 
              because the indivisible simplicity 
              is not properly nor really distinguishable from itself, 
              and the mission of the Holy Spirit, etc. is of this type.
              The major is known. 
              The minor is proved 
              because otherwise 
              the Holy Spirit would at sometime 
              begin to have a disposition or real production 
              which it did not have from eternity, 
              which is false.

              as perfectly as the Holy Spirit is produced in the

              to some point of acting meritoriously it is the efficient principle 
              and is sufficiently gratifying and gratuitously elevating of the mind.
              But a gift of gratuitously caused grace is of this type. 
              Proof: because the created gift elevates so intensely 
              for the power to act well, just as to be well, 
              and conversely, 
              therefore when it elevates to intrinsecally being well,

              uniteable to a subject,

              a first disposition of the gift 
              or of the uncreated form. 
              Therefore the Holy Spirit by itself 
              is not able to gratify the mind 
              or deliver grace.

              therefore this has sufficient 
              imputability or activity for the remission of guilt. 
              The consequence is clear. 
              The antecedent is proved because 
              through created charity the mind

              would be able to merit eternal life, 
              each is false. 
              The consequence is proved 
              because since love is the gift Holy Spirit, 
              if this is had without the Holy Spirit, 
              then either it would render that one sufficiently beloved for eternal life 
              or not. If not, then it would follow 
              that charity does not denote one who is beloved, 
              which is the first inconvenience. 
              If so, 
              then the second inconvenience follows, 
              namely that such a person would merit, 
              while not having, eternal life, 
              that is the Holy Spirit.

            Third conclusion: 
            that Christ, so that he would show this temporal procession of the Holy Spirit 
            is not other than giving of this power, after the resurrection 
            gave himself one time on earth on account of love of the neighbor, 
            and another time from heaven on account of the love of God 
            on the day of Pentacost.

            Fourth conclusion: 
            that the gifts of the only the gifts of the Holy Spirit 
            are given to us, 
            but also the Holy Spirit is given to us
            who is equal to the Father and the Son 
            and is the third person in the Trinity 
            against some holding the opposite position.

          <p xml:id="pgb1q13-d1e1088">
            Fifth conclusion: 
            that holy men and prelates 
            are not able to give the Holy Spirit 
            nor do they have the authority of giving, 
            though they have the ministry, 
            because sometimes it is give by God 
            through some ministerially and instrumentally, 
            and sometimes it is given through others, etc.
