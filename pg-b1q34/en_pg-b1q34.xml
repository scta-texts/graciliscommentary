              But this is false 
              because then there would be some infinite passive potency

              The consequent is false. 
              The consequence is clear 
              because nothing would be able to resist omnipotence,

              First conclusion:
              though it may be that something is omnipotent 
              and that it does not have in itself every power formally, 
              nevertheless it is necessary 
              that the <unclear>one and only</unclear> first producer of all things 
              has power according to virtue, grade, and vigor. <!-- translation/transcription check -->
              The first part of the conclusion is proved 
              because God is omnipotent 
              and does not have every power in himself formally, 
              therefore the conclusion is true.
              The first part of the antecedent is clear. 
              The second is proved 
              because some powers are called imperfections, 
              therefore they should not be put in God formally 
              but only virtually.
              The antecedent is clear from passive potencies.
              Again 
              the antecedent is proved from the active potencies of creatures 
              which have a joined imperfection and limitation, 
              and consequently ought not to be put in God formally 
              but only virtually, 
              just as the potency of running, eating, speaking, 
              and similar kinds of potencies. 
              But potencies of willing and understanding 
              are in God formally and are God 
              because they are and they refer to a perfection absolutely.

              First corollary: 
              no one explains divine omnipotence 
              well and sufficiently 
              as the power to do whatever does not imply a contradiction. <!-- transl dbheck -->
              This is clear because a sin is doable, 
              and nevertheless God is not able to do it, 
              therefore.

              Second corollary: 
              to the degree that it is necessary that the creature is possible 
              so to the same degree
              it is necessary that the creature is makable by omnipotence.
              This is clear 
              because 
              it follows, 
              no creature is able to be, 
              therefore no power is able to make the creature to be, 
              therefore divine omnipotence 
              is not able to make the creature to be.

            <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3373">
              Third corollary: 
              it is the case that
              something is omnipotent 
              and not be sufficiently powerful for something producible.
              This is clear 
              because if this is not so, 
              then the Son would not be omnipotent

              Second conclusion: 
              though through the infinite immensity

              the ratio of the supreme being should be inferred, 
              nevertheless no producible effect

              or is able to be an adequate term to divine omnipotence.
              The first part is proved 
              for it is not the case

              Again, 
              note that part of the ratio of omnipotence
              is that it is free, 
              from which it is clear that 
              to say <mentioned>omnipotence</mentioned> 
              is to say something more than 
              <mentioned>infinite power</mentioned>.
              Whence, 
              if there were an infinite power 
              and it were not free, 
              then this would not be omnipotence.
              The second part of the conclusion 
              is proved because, 
              if thus, 
              it follows that
              when such a thing is produced into existence 
              God would not be able to produce something 
              unless he would destroy that either completely or in part.
              The consequent seems inconvenient.
              The consequences is clear 
              because since this effect would be adequate to divine omnipotence, 
              it would contain every perfection able to be produced.
              Or, 
              if it did not contain every such perfection, 
              it follows that the term would not be adequate to the thing 
              which is opposed to what has been posited, 
              therefore the conclusion is true.

            First conclusion: 
            that God the trinity is omnipotent 
            because he is able to do all things 
            that are able to be possible 
            <pb ed="#L" n="103-v"/>
            or which are suitable for him to be able to do. <!-- transl check -->
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3880">
            Second conclusion: 
            that God is able to do some things through himself,
            like to create the heavens, 
            somethings he is able to do not in himself 
            but in creatures, 
            like motion, 
            and somethings he is said not to be able to do, 
            like sin, suffer, deceive, and to die 
            because the power for these things is not 
            a type of power but a type of infirmity. 
            For God is able to do all things 
            but only does what suits his truth 
            and justice.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3892">
            Third conclusion: 
            that God by himself and through himself 
            is able to do all things.
            But a creature 
            neither by itself 
            nor through itself
            is able to do something. 
            The Son of God through himself 
            is able to all things 
            but not from himself
            because he does not have himself 
            the ability to do all things 
            but has this from the Father 
            from whom he has being.
            And this is similarly 
            the case for the Holy Spirit.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3903">
            Fourth conclusion: 
            that God is able to make occur whatever he wishes 
            and is able to do whatever he wishes that would be able to do 
            and conversely he wishes that he is able to do whatever he is able to do. 
            Nevertheless not everything that he wishes he is able to do 
            is something that he wishes to occur 
            because then everything that he would be able to do 
            would occur, 
            since his will is omnipotent 
            and nothing is able to resists it.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="pgb1q34-d1e3914">
            And it should be known, 
            it is therefore not said that God is omnipotent 
            because he is able to do whatever he wishes 
            because then any blessed person would be omnipotent 
            because such a person is able to do 
            whatever they wish would occur 
            and whatever they wish that they are able to do.
